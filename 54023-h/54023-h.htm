<p class="drop-cap-preface"><span class="uc">This</span> volume contains papers on some questions
of local history put together, mostly for undergraduate
societies and magazines, at various times
during the last twenty-five years. I have included a
memoir, written for a London Society, on Newton’s
<cite>Principia</cite>, a work that profoundly affected the development
of University studies in the eighteenth
century, and a chapter on the History of the
Mathematical Tripos, which at one time appeared
in my <cite>Mathematical Recreations and Essays</cite>, since
these are concerned with Cambridge subjects.</p>

<p>I print the papers, whether long or short, and
whether read at length or, as was more often the
case, curtailed in delivery, substantially in the
form in which they were first written. This leaves
allusions which bear evidence to their domestic
origin, and involves, in those of them dealing with
cognate subjects, some repetition of facts. If these
are defects they could be removed only by rewriting
much of what appears here; it seems to me preferable
to let the essays stand in their original forms,
save occasionally for the addition of a paragraph or
<a name="png.006" id="png.006" href="#png.006"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>vi<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sentence dealing with what has happened since they
were first presented. The dates in the text are
reckoned in the modern style, taking the year as
beginning on the first day of January.</p>

 /><small>THE FOUNDATION OF TRINITY COLLEGE.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">Trinity College</span> was founded by Henry VIII
in 1546. To obtain a site for it, he suppressed
King’s Hall and Michael-House, two medieval
colleges which were built on or owned most
of the ground now occupied by the Great Court, and
with their revenues, largely augmented by property
of dissolved monasteries, he endowed it. The scheme
of the College and his objects in founding it are stated
in his letters patent of 19 December 1546, and particulars
of the income assigned by him to the foundation
are set out in his charter of dotation dated
24 December 1546. These documents have been
printed<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn1" id="fna1" name="fna1">1</a></sup> and are readily accessible, but the history
of the events leading up to the foundation of the
College is less generally known. I cannot promise
that the story in itself is interesting but the material
facts have never before been brought together<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn2" id="fna2" name="fna2">2</a></sup> so
its telling is justified.</p>

<p><a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>After the dissolution of the monastic houses,
anxiety was felt in Cambridge and Oxford lest they
should suffer a similar fate. The policy of the suppression
of the two universities and the confiscation
of their property was openly advocated by politicians
at court, and naturally great alarm was felt
when in 1544 an Act<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn3" id="fna3" name="fna3">3</a></sup> was passed empowering the
king to dissolve any college at either university,
and appropriate its possessions.</p>

<p>The universities were right in thinking that the
danger was pressing, for Parker, who played a
leading part in the affair, has put on record<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn4" id="fna4" name="fna4">4</a></sup> the
fact that after the passing of the Act certain courtiers
importunately sued the king to have the possessions
of both bodies surveyed, meaning afterwards
to obtain the same on easy terms. In these circumstances
the Cambridge authorities, says Strype,
“looked about them and made all the friends they
could at court to save themselves.” In particular
they urgently begged the aid of two of their professors,
John Cheke, then acting as tutor to the
prince of Wales, and Thomas Smith, then clerk to
the queen’s council. Here is the letter<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn5" id="fna5" name="fna5">5</a></sup> of the
senate to Smith on the subject:</p>

<blockquote xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">
<p>Si tu is es, Clarissime Smithe, in quem Academia haec
Cantabrigiensis universas vires suas, universa pietatis jura

Academia nil debet tibi, imo omnia sua in te transfudit.
Et propterea abs te non simpliciter petit beneficium, sed

efficies. Jesus te diutissime servet incolumem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parker tells us that the London friends of the
University, among whom Smith and Cheke were
doubtless conspicuous, wisely took the line of welcoming
an enquiry, but begged the king to avoid
the expense of a costly investigation. Their representations
were successful, and he issued a commission<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn6" id="fna6" name="fna6">6</a></sup>
dated 16 January 1546 to Matthew Parker
(then vice-chancellor, and later archbishop of Canterbury),
John Redman (warden of King’s Hall,
chaplain to the king, and later master of Trinity),
and William Mey (president of Queens’, and later
archbishop-elect of York) to report to him on the
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>revenues of the colleges and the numbers of students
sustained therewith. The commissioners were capable
and friendly.</p>

<p>The king must have been impatient to know the
facts, for in less than a week, on 21 January, he
ordered Parker to come to Hampton Court with the
report. Immediate compliance was impossible, but
the command may well have stimulated the commissioners
to act as rapidly as possible. In fact
they obtained the services of eleven clerks from the
Court of Augmentations in London, and at once set
to work to collect information.</p>

<p>The University was keenly alive to the risks it
was incurring. To placate the king, the senate,
on 13 February, put all its belongings at his service,
and when forwarding a copy of the grace to Secretary
Sir William Paget it reminded him of the value
of the University to the state, and begged his protection.
At the same time it addressed the queen,
Katharine Parr, through Thomas Smith, imploring
her advocacy.<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn7" id="fna7" name="fna7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The queen replied<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn8" id="fna8" name="fna8">8</a></sup> on 26 February. After
complaining that he had written to her in Latin,
though he could equally well have expressed himself
in the vulgar tongue, she discoursed at length on the
duties of members of the University, and, saying that
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>she was confident that her wishes in these respects
would be fulfilled, she concluded her letter as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I (according to your desires) have attempted my lord
the King’s Majesty, for the establishment of your livelihood
and possessions: in which, notwithstanding his Majesty’s
property and interest, through the consent of the high court
of parliament, his Highness being such a patron to good
learning, doth tender you so much, that he will rather advance
learning and erect new occasion thereof than [to]
confound those your ancient and godly institutions, so that
learning may hereafter justly ascribe her very original whole
conservation and sure stay to our Sovereign Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was good news, and things now moved
rapidly. By the end of February the commissioners
had drawn up a detailed report giving the information
required. It is printed<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn9" id="fna9" name="fna9">9</a></sup> at length in the
<cite>Cambridge Documents</cite>, 1852, and occupies nearly
200 pages.</p>

<p>The commissioners in person presented to the
king at Hampton Court a brief summary of this
report. We do not know the date of this interview,
but conjecturally it may be put as being early in
March. Parker has left<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn10" id="fna10" name="fna10">10</a></sup> in his own handwriting a
full account of their reception as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the end, the said commissioners resorted up to
Hampton Court to present to the King a brief summary
written in a fair sheet of vellum (which very book is yet
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reserved in the college of Corpus Christi) describing the
revenues, the reprises, the allowances, and number and stipend
of every College. Which book the King diligently
perused; and in a certain admiration said to certain of his
lords which stood by, that he thought he had not in his
realm so many persons so honestly maintained in living by
so little land and rent: and where he asked of us what it
meant that the most part of Colleges should seem to expend
yearly more than their revenues amounted to; we answered
that it rose partly of fines for leases and indentures of the
farmers renewing their leases, partly of wood sales: whereupon
he said to the lords, that pity it were these lands
should be altered to make them worse; (at which words some
were grieved, for that they disappointed <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">lupos quosdam
hiantes</i>). In fine, we sued to the King’s Majesty to be so
gracious lord, that he would favour us in the continuance
of our possessions such as they were, and that no man by
his grace’s letters should require to permute with us to give
us worse. He made answer and smiled, that he could not
but write for his servants and others, doing the service for
the realm in wars and other affairs, but he said he would
put us to our choice whether we should gratify them or no,
and bade us hold our own, for after his writing he would
force us no further. With which words we were well armed,
and so departed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This important interview was followed by a
rumour that it was Henry’s intention to found at
Cambridge a new and magnificent college to serve
as an enduring record of his interest in learning,
and perhaps the University may have taken the
queen’s letter as indicating what was coming. It is
believed that Henry had long entertained vague
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ideas of the kind, but that the definite suggestion,
which was encouraged by the queen, originated with
Redman, who, as royal chaplain, had constant access
to the king and considerable influence with him.</p>

<p>The preparations for Henry’s proposed foundation
were made with extreme speed: a wise course in
view of his failing health and variable temper. It
was decided to take advantage of the Act of 1544
and suppress King’s Hall and Michael-House, using
their grounds and adjoining property as the site of
the new college. We have no reference to the appointment
of commissioners for the business, though
there is an allusion, quoted later, to receivers: perhaps
the matter was left in the hands of the officials
of the Court of Augmentations. Redman was the
chief authority at Cambridge in the arrangements
that had to be made there, and it was intended that
he should be the first master of the new college when
it was founded.</p>

<p>The two Societies above mentioned were (save
for Peterhouse) the oldest in the University. To
Trinity men their history has, naturally, great interest,
and I interpolate a few remarks on this and
their position in 1546.</p>

<p>The King’s Scholars, normally thirty-two in
number and of all ages from fourteen upwards, were
established by Edward II under a warden in 1317
and incorporated in 1337. They had for their
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>original home a large house (King’s Hall) situated
on the grass plot and walk in front of the present
chapel, and rapidly acquired all the adjacent land
between the High Street (now known as Trinity
Street) and the river, extending their buildings
in various directions. Popular writers sometimes
assert or assume that all medieval colleges were
founded for poor students. That is not universally
true. No condition of poverty was imposed on the
scholars of King’s Hall, nor was their life here penurious:
they had a dining-hall, library, common room,
chapel, kitchens, a brewery, a vineyard, a garden,
and a staff of servants maintained by the Society,
while a good many of them also kept their own
private servants: they received a liberal allowance
for daily commons, clothes and bedding were supplied
from the royal wardrobe, and pocket-money was
given to buy other things. They were appointed
by the crown largely from among the families of
court officials, nominations being restricted to those
who knew Latin. After completing their course
many of these students entered what we may call
the higher civil service of the time in church or state.</p>

<p>In the report of the commissioners, the annual
income of King’s Hall was returned as <i>£</i>214. 0<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
and the expenses as <i>£</i>263. 16<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>; and it was
stated that at the time there were on its boards,
a master, twenty-five graduate fellows, and seven
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>undergraduate fellows, besides servants. The Society
owned the patronage of the livings of Arrington,
Bottisham, St Mary’s Cambridge, Chesterton, Fakenham,
Felmersham, and Grendon. According to
the return, the normal annual expenditure of King’s
Hall, if all the scholars resided, required <i>£</i>182. 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for the emoluments of the warden and fellows (namely,
<i>£</i>8. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the warden, <i>£</i>5. 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for each of
twenty-five graduate fellows, and <i>£</i>5. 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for each
of seven undergraduate fellows); <i>£</i>32. 2<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for the
college servants (namely, the butler, barber, baker,
brewer, laundress, cook, under-cook, and the warden’s
servant); <i>£</i>3. 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the estate officers and quit-rents;
<i>£</i>3. 19<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the expenses of the chapel services
and the bible-clerk; <i>£</i>5. 0<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for firing for the
hall and kitchen; <i>£</i>5. 0<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for rushes for the hall;
<i>£</i>5. 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the exequies of the founder and the
following refections; <i>£</i>29. 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for repairs and
renewals; and <i>£</i>10 for extraordinary expenses.</p>

<p>The other College (Michael-House) whose buildings
were transferred to Trinity was of a different
type. It was founded by Hervey de Stanton in
1324 for a master and six secular clergy who wished
to study in the University. Their original home
was a large house on the site of the present combination
room and the land round it; later they
acquired all the property between Foul Lane and
the river. At first the Society’s means were barely
<a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>s</a>ufficient for its needs, but in time it received many
gifts, and the foundation was increased to a master
and eight priests with chaplains and bible-clerks.
It had an oratory in its House but did not need a
chapel as it owned St Michael’s Church; traces of
this ownership will be noticed in the arrangement
for stalls (to be occupied by members of the Society)
in the choir, which is sunk below the level of the
nave and chancel.</p>

<p>In the report of the commissioners, the annual
income of Michael-House was returned as <i>£</i>141. 13<i>s.</i> 1¾<i>d.</i>
and its expenses as <i>£</i>143. 18<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; and it was stated
that there were on its boards a master, eight fellows,
and three chaplains, besides servants. Besides
St Michael’s Cambridge, the Society owned the
patronage of the livings of Barrington, Boxworth,
Cheadle, Grundisburgh, and Orwell. According to
the return, the normal annual expenditure of
Michael-House required a sum of <i>£</i>91. 10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for
the emoluments of the Society (namely, <i>£</i>7. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
for the master, <i>£</i>47. 17<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the six fellows
on the original foundation, <i>£</i>11. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for the
two Illegh fellows, <i>£</i>15 for three chaplains, one of
whom served Barrington, and <i>£</i>10 for four bible-clerks),
<i>£</i>1 for the auditor, <i>£</i>6. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for college
servants (namely, the cook, butler, barber, and
laundress), rather more than <i>£</i>17 for the exequies
of benefactors, <i>£</i>1. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the commemoration
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>refection, <i>£</i>20 for repairs, and <i>£</i>6. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for extraordinary
expenses. A clerical society like Michael-House
had no difficulty in providing for due
celebration of the exequies of its friends, and in
fact more than twenty benefactors are mentioned
by name as being thus commemorated every year.
In 1544, the House, presumably with the object of
averting its destruction, began to admit students
resident elsewhere in the University, and in a couple
of years no less than forty-eight students matriculated
from it; the number of admissions must have
exceeded this, but what was involved in such cases
by admission is uncertain.</p>

<p>A scheme containing a “first plott or proportion”
for the new College was prepared for the king
by the Court of Augmentations in London; it seems
certain that this was worked out in collaboration
with Redman. The clerk who drew it up was
Thomas Ansill. The College, after its foundation,
recognized its obligation to him in the matter and
presented him to the vicarage of Barford which was
and is in its gift. He preserved a copy of his scheme;
this was purchased from his son by one of the fellows
in 1611, and given to the College.</p>

<p>The manuscript of the suggested scheme, to
which Mr Bird first called my attention, is endorsed
<cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio Collegii</cite> and headed “the proporcon
diuised for Trinite College.” It is undated,
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but in a later hand it is added that it was made
Anno 37 Hen. 8, and therefore before 22 April 1546.
From internal evidence it must have been composed
in or after March in that year, since those who
graduated in that Lent term are described as being
of the standing of the degrees then taken. Of
those who graduated afterwards some are described
correctly, others not so: doubtless Redman knew
about the standing of the members of King’s Hall
and Michael-House, but he may well have made
mistakes about the standing of some of the junior
students of other colleges. If however we accept
the endorsement as correct, we may fix the date
of the composition of the plan as being in the early
half of April, 1546. This manuscript has not been
printed, and I proceed to describe it.</p>

<p>The object of the compilers of this scheme was
to see what income would be required for the suggested
new College, and to arrange how the income
should be used; incidentally it reveals the general
organization proposed. The constitution of the
College, the various offices to be created, and the
stipends intended are specified. In most cases
the names of the proposed fellows, scholars, bedesmen,
and servants are given, but generally the
allocation of the proposed principal offices is not
indicated and probably had not been then arranged.
The names of the proposed fellows and scholars
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>agree with those appointed later, though the order
is not always the same, but the provisional list of
bedesmen differs from that of those ultimately
nominated.</p>

<p>The <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio</cite> begins with a statement of the
names and suggested stipends of the master and
fellows. The stipend of the master was to be <i>£</i>100
a year: that of each of the next fifteen fellows (one
of those proposed being a doctor of divinity, ten
bachelors of divinity, and four masters of arts) was
to be <i>£</i>10 a year and <i>£</i>1 a year for livery: that of
each of the next twenty-five fellows (twenty-two of
those nominated being masters of arts and three
bachelors of arts) was to be <i>£</i>8 a year; that of each
of the next twenty fellows and scholars (seven of
the nominees being bachelors of arts and thirteen
junior scholars) was to be <i>£</i>6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year. The
names are given and agree with those in the letters
patent of 19 December.</p>

<p>There was to be a schoolmaster (Richard Harman)
who was to have <i>£</i>20 a year, an usher of
grammar (William Boude) who was to have <i>£</i>10 a
year, and provision was made for forty childer
grammarians, whose names are given, each of whom
was to have <i>£</i>4 a year. This shows that it was intended
that the foundation should include students
in grammar, and the two teachers specially responsible
for them were to be a schoolmaster and usher.</p>

<p><a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The question arises whether it was intended to
found a grammar-school connected with the College
or whether these grammarians were what we should
call undergraduate scholars or exhibitioners. The
former view is the correct one, for the royal commissioners
in May 1549 definitely asked<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn11" id="fna11" name="fna11">11</a></sup> the College
“to surrender the Grammar Schole.” This was done
and the school was then absorbed in the College.
Probably at that time the distinction between boys
at the grammar-school and junior undergraduates
was not regarded as important—the term grammarian
or grammaticus being commonly used for
a junior undergraduate as well as a school-boy<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn12" id="fna12" name="fna12">12</a></sup>.
This indifference to the distinction between the two
classes is illustrated by the fact that of the grammarian
school-boys named in the <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio</cite>, ten
were already matriculated members of the University,
nine matriculated from Trinity shortly after its
foundation, and of the others six matriculated in
1548 or 1549 which is not inconsistent with their
having been students of the University in 1546.</p>

<p>In 1547, the accounts include a particular payment
for six boys of the grammar-school, and wages
for one quarter for the schoolmaster and Mr Boude;
thus showing that the school was then being
carried on. In 1548, the accounts specify forty-two
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>grammatici, in addition to certain graduates and
dialectici, as being in residence, but in this year there
is no mention of a schoolmaster or an usher though
possibly they may be included among the ten
lectors for whom provision is made. In 1551 the
grammatici appear as discipuli, and thenceforth
the grammarians were treated as undergraduate
scholars.</p>

<p>The <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio</cite> next goes on to enumerate seven
readers. Three of these were to be public or university
readers, of whom one (John Maydew) was
to read in divinity, one (John Cheke) in Greek, and
one (Thomas Wakefield) in Hebrew, each at <i>£</i>40
a year. The other four were to be fellows of the
College, of whom one (Simon Bridges) was to read
in divinity at <i>£</i>6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year, two in philosophy
at <i>£</i>5 a year each, and one in logic at <i>£</i>5 a year:
such stipends to be in addition to their fellowship
emoluments. It would seem that Bridges
or Briggs declined to accept the nomination to a
fellowship at Trinity and accordingly was not appointed
to the office. Provision was also made for
two under-readers in logic at <i>£</i>2. 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> each. Next
are mentioned two examiners in scholastic acts at
<i>£</i>5 a year each; and two chaplains at <i>£</i>6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a
year each, one (Henry Man) for the fellows and the
other (unnamed) for the childer and bedesmen.
I note that Henry Man occupied for many years
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rooms in the Great Court adjoining and on the west
side of what is now known as the Queen’s Gate.</p>

<p>The next entry is that of twenty-four almsmen
or bedesmen at <i>£</i>6 a year each; the names of all
but one are given, but the list differs somewhat
from that appearing in the account book of 1547
of those appointed when the College began work.
The unnamed bedesman was the cook of Michael-House,
and it is impossible not to wonder whether
his inclusion in this list (which involved his retirement
from the kitchens) was due to the memory of
indifferent dinners eaten by Redman when a guest
at the high table of that House.</p>

<p>The <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio</cite> then returns to the enumeration
of the officers and servants of the College. There
were to be two bursars at <i>£</i>4 a year each; a vice-master
at <i>£</i>5 a year; two deans to direct disputations
of divinity and philosophy, one at <i>£</i>4 a year,
and the other at <i>£</i>3. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year; eight bible-clerks,
whose names are given, to serve the hall,
choir and vestry, and to attend upon the curate
when visiting, at <i>£</i>2. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year each; an organ-player
at <i>£</i>6 a year and his commons; two butlers,
the senior at <i>£</i>5 a year and the junior at <i>£</i>4 a year;
a manciple at <i>£</i>6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year; a master-cook at
<i>£</i>6 a year; two under-cooks, one at <i>£</i>4 a year, and
the other at <i>£</i>3. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year; and a turn-spit at
<i>£</i>2 a year. There was also to be a barber at <i>£</i>5
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a year; a laundress at <i>£</i>5 a year; a porter at <i>£</i>6
a year; a bricklayer at <i>£</i>4 a year; a carpenter at <i>£</i>4
a year; a mason at <i>£</i>4 a year; two stewards of lands
at <i>£</i>5 a year each; an auditor for the lands at <i>£</i>10
a year; a receiver for the lands at <i>£</i>13. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; and
an attorney in the exchequer for the lands at
<i>£</i>3. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Allowance was to be made for the
yearly distribution of alms to the amount of <i>£</i>20;
and of another <i>£</i>20 to be spent on the mending of
highways. The total expenditure contemplated
amounts to <i>£</i>1286. At the end in another handwriting
is added that allowance (amount unspecified)
should be also made for wine and wax, riding, extraordinary
charges, and repairs.</p>

<p>It must have been in April, or early in May,
1546, that the commissioners, or other officials concerned,
took possession of King’s Hall and Michael-House
and the ground adjacent thereto. They at
once made arrangements to shut up Foul Lane
which ran across the present Great Court, to purchase
such part of that court as did not belong to
King’s Hall and Michael-House, and to enclose the
site. Stone and other materials for the new work
were taken from the church and cloisters of the
dissolved Franciscan monastery which stood on the
land now occupied by Sidney Sussex College, and
in a survey, dated 20 May 1546, those buildings
are described as having been already partially
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>demolished in order to provide “towards the building
of the King’s Majesty’s new College.”</p>

<p>It is probable that during this time members of
King’s Hall and Michael-House were in residence,
and possibly also some of the members-elect of
Trinity College. The cost of the maintenance of
the House and the expenses of the alterations must
have been heavy, but in December 1546, the Court
of Augmentations was ordered<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn13" id="fna13" name="fna13">13</a></sup> “to pay Dr Redman
of your new College in Cambridge <i>£</i>2000 towards
the establishment and building of the same, and
in recompense for revenues of their lands for a
whole year ended Michaelmas last, because the
rents were paid to your Majesty’s receivers before
they had out letters patent for their donation.”
We have no record of these expenses, but I conjecture
that this grant allowed a clean start to be
made from Michaelmas 1546.</p>

<p>The members of the new College entered into
possession of the buildings and began their academic
life as members of Trinity College about Michaelmas
1546. The surrender of King’s Hall and Michael-House
to the king took place on 28 October, and
arrangements were than made to pension the master
and eight fellows of Michael-House and one fellow
of King’s Hall. Redman was appointed master of
the new foundation.</p>

<p><a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The original members of the Society were selected
from the whole University with the addition
of a few Oxonians: it is believed that all the nominees
were favourable to the new learning and the protestant
faith. Of the forty childer grammarians
named in the <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio</cite> all save one accepted the
nomination; of these, six had been previously
members of Michael-House, one a member of Pembroke,
one of Peterhouse, one of St John’s, and
one of some unnamed College. Of the sixty
students nominated to fellowships or scholarships
in the letters patent, fourteen did not reside and
presumably refused the nomination. Of the forty-six
who accepted the office, thirty-six were graduates
and ten were non-graduates. Of these
thirty-six nominees, three came from Michael-House,
one from King’s Hall, two from Christ’s, one
from Corpus, one from King’s, one from Pembroke,
two from Peterhouse, one from Queens’, one from
St Catharine’s, and three from St John’s: of the
colleges or hostels from which the remaining twenty
had graduated, I can find no particulars. Of the
ten non-graduates who accepted the office, one had
been at Pembroke, one at Queens’, two at St John’s,
and one at Trinity Hall: of the previous history of
the remaining five I know nothing. Of the fourteen
who did not reside and presumably declined the
offer, eleven were graduates, of whom one had been
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at Corpus, one at King’s, one at Pembroke, three at
Queens’, two at St John’s, and two at Oxford, and
of the remaining graduate I can find no particulars.
Of the three non-graduates who did not accept the
nomination, one had been at Michael-House, one at
Oxford, and of the other I know nothing. It appears
from the account-books that there were also
still in residence a few students<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn14" id="fna14" name="fna14">14</a></sup> who had been
members of King’s Hall and Michael-House: it was
only courteous to give these deposed students the
hospitality of the House, and they occupied a
different position to the pensioners and fellow-commoners
who later were admitted in considerable
numbers. We cannot prove or disprove the presence
at this time of other students, but it is most
likely that at first there were no residents in College
other than those mentioned above.</p>

<p>The legal formalities connected with the surrender
of the properties of King’s Hall and Michael-House
took a considerable time, and were not completed
till 17 December 1546. The letters patent
founding the College and the charter of dotation
were signed a few days later<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn15" id="fna15" name="fna15">15</a></sup>. The actual endowment
granted was valued at <i>£</i>1640 net a year,
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which must have been deemed ample to provide
for the expenses and the maintenance of the House.
Comparing this income and the estimated expenditure
with those of King’s Hall and Michael-House
we gather how much more important than these
colleges was the contemplated new foundation.</p>

<p>Thus were King’s Hall and Michael-House dissolved,
but only to be merged in a new and nobler
Society. The letters patent founding Trinity College
state that Henry to the glory and honour of
Almighty God and the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
for the amplification and establishment of the
Christian and true religion, the extirpation of
heresy and false opinion, the increase and continuance
of divine learning and all kinds of godliness,
the knowledge of language, the education of
youth in piety virtue discipline and learning, the
relief of the poor and destitute, the prosperity of
the Church of Christ, and the common good and
happiness of his kingdom and subjects, founded and
established a College of letters, sciences, philosophy;
godliness, and sacred theology, for all time to endure.
These are noble objects, and we may look back with
honourable pride to the way in which Trinity College
has on the whole carried out the intentions of its
founder.</p>

<p>The organization of the new College followed
closely that outlined in the <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Distribucio</cite>. To meet
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the expenses already incurred during the Michaelmas
term the Court of Augmentations<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn16" id="fna16" name="fna16">16</a></sup> in January
1547 paid Redman <i>£</i>590 “towards the exhibition of
King’s Scholars in Cambridge.” This was about
one-third of the total intended income of the House,
and presumably cleared matters up to 24 December
1546, when the College entered into possession of
its endowments. If we may trust the sermon
preached in London on 12 December 1550, by
Thomas Lever, subsequently master of St John’s
College, Trinity had reason to regret the death of
Henry in January 1547, for the preacher asserted
that a substantial part of the intended endowment
was appropriated by courtiers in London; I have
never investigated what part (if any) of it was thus
lost to the College.</p>

<p>The first account-book of the new College covers
the civil year 1547, but only certain selected items
of income and expenditure appear therein. It
shows total receipts of <i>£</i>786. 16<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> and total payments
of <i>£</i>799. 11<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> Most of the income is said
to have come from the “Tower.” I conjecture
that rents, etc. were paid to the master who kept
the college moneys in the treasury in the Tower,
and the bursar in his book accounted only for such
portion of it as was handed to him: of other sums
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>received or paid on account of the Society, we have
no particulars. In most cases the commons (though
not the stipends or wages) paid to officers are set
out, but up to Lady-Day instead of giving full details
there is an entry of <i>£</i>52. 6<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> paid to fellows
and scholars for “the first quarter after the erection,
besides stipends and wages.” The account-book
for the next year, 1548, is better kept. It shows
total receipts of <i>£</i>531. 13<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i> and total payments
of <i>£</i>528. 12<i>s.</i> 8½<i>d.</i> In the accounts of this year are
mentioned a master, fifty graduate fellows (of whom
thirteen were bachelors), ten dialectici, forty-two
grammarians, and eight bible-clerks. Entries appear
of payments for commons to six former
members of King’s Hall and Michael-House, but of
these only three seem to have been in regular residence.
An examination of the early account-books
allows us to see something of the development of
the College, but a description of this would hardly
come within the purview of this paper.</p>

 /><small>THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">The</span> word Tutor is used at Cambridge to describe
an officer of a College who stands to his
pupils in loco parentis; now-a-days he may, but
does not necessarily, give direct instruction to them.
The object of this chapter is to describe the development
of the office in Trinity College.</p>

<p>Trinity College was founded in 1546 by Henry VIII.
It is, however, essential in dealing with its early
history to bear in mind that it was founded in a pre-existing<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn17" id="fna17" name="fna17">17</a></sup>
University having well-established rules
and customs. Nearly all the original members of
Trinity had been educated at Cambridge, they were
familiar with its traditions, and even the buildings
they occupied were associated with the college life
of earlier times. It was intended that the Society
should promote the reformed religion and the new
learning, but there is no reason to suppose that in
establishing it, it was wished or proposed to alter
the existing practice about the tuition, guidance,
and care of the younger students.</p>

<p>In the system in force in the University shortly
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>before the foundation of Trinity, the students corresponding
to our scholars and sizars lived in endowed
colleges (of which eight were founded before 1353 and
seven between 1440 and 1520), most of those corresponding
to our pensioners in unendowed private
hostels (of which in the sixteenth century there were
twenty-seven and in earlier times possibly a few
more), and most of those belonging to religious
orders in monasteries or monastic hostels. A student
on admission to the University was apprenticed to
some master of arts or doctor who directed the
lad’s studies until he took a master’s degree. This
graduate was known as the student’s “master”:
in the case of a member of a college we may assume
that the master was chosen from among the senior
members of the House, though it is doubtful if this
was necessarily so in the case of the hostels. The
head of a college or hostel was responsible for the
conduct and control of the lad in non-scholastic
matters, but in colleges in later times this work
was assigned to a dean. Thus for practical purposes
a tutorial system already existed in the
medieval system of apprenticeship and control.</p>

<p>The royal scheme for Trinity College comprised
a master, fifteen senior fellows, twenty-five middle
fellows, twenty junior fellows (of whom, in 1546,
thirteen were undergraduates), and forty grammarian
school-boys. In addition to these, there were
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>servant-students (known as sizars or subsizars), each
being attached as gyp to a particular fellow, and
receiving education, board, and lodging in lieu of
money wages. There is nothing to show whether or
not the presence of pensioners was contemplated.</p>

<p>We have a list, apparently complete, of all the
intended officers; tutors do not appear among them,
though a schoolmaster and usher were provided for
the grammarians. Hence it would seem that the
relation between an apprenticed undergraduate and
his master was regarded as personal, and that the
latter was selected and paid by his pupil or pupil’s
guardian, and not by or through the College—I conjecture
that this was the usual medieval practice.
The deans are mentioned as officers of the College,
and the discipline of the younger members was part
of their business, though no doubt a lad’s master or
tutor assisted in enforcing it. The formal charter
of foundation was given by Henry in December
1546, but the grammarians are not mentioned
therein.</p>

<p>During the next six years, 1546–1552, three important
developments took place. First, the grammar-school
side of the College was abandoned, and
all boys then in the school were entered as scholars
of the House; next, and perhaps consequent on the
abolition of the school, a distinction between fellows
and scholars was drawn; and finally, following the
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>growing custom of other colleges, the admission of
pensioners was definitely recognized as desirable,
thus introducing a class of students below the
standing of scholars. Before coming to the subject
of tutors it will be well to add a word or two about
the pensioners and scholars of these early days.</p>

<p>With the upset of the medieval scheme of education
the number of pensioners and fellow-commoners
seeking admission to the University greatly
decreased, and the reception of a limited number
of them in the colleges fairly met the needs of the
University. The private hostels were then no
longer wanted and being unendowed disappeared.
Thus when again, as soon happened, the number
of would-be pensioners increased, it was necessary
(unless new non-collegiate arrangements were made
for their reception in the University) to admit them
in larger numbers to the colleges.<!-- TN: period invisible in scan --> At Trinity a limit
was, in theory, placed on the number of pensioners
admissible, but not on that of fellow-commoners.
A pensioner at Trinity, and I suppose also at other
colleges, had to be qualified by learning and morals
for admission, and I conceive further that his entry
was conditional on his finding a fellow who would
receive him. A pensioner or fellow-commoner had
no rights, and resided only on such terms and as
long as the College or the fellow receiving him
willed. I believe that students of this class did not
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>often stay here for more than three or four years
unless in due course they became scholars.</p>

<p>A most important question for the new College
was how the supply of scholars and fellows should
be provided. In King’s Hall vacancies were filled
by royal nomination, and boys came into residence
as scholars-elect. We do not know what was proposed
in 1546, but I think that, as far as entry
to the grammar-school was concerned, nomination
by the senior fellows was the most likely method
to have been contemplated. The abandonment of
the school and the enrolment of all its members
as scholars of the House must however have raised
the question in an acute form, and it was settled
in or before 1552 by the establishment of an annual
examination for the election of scholars. Probably
from the first it was intended that the new
fellows should be formally elected and admitted.</p>

<p>The charter of 1546 contains a reference to
statutes to be given later by the king. There was
considerable delay in preparing these, and the
liberty of action thus left to the Society seems to
have been used unwisely, for the commissioners of
1549 reported that its state was “much out of
order, governed at large and pleasure for want of
statutes ... the fellows for the most part too
bad.”</p>

<p>In November 1552 the College received the long-expected
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>statutes by which it was to be governed:
with their appearance we leave the field of conjecture
and come to facts. The foundation as here
described included a master, fifty fellows of the
standing of master or doctor, and sixty bachelor
and undergraduate scholars: provision was also made
for student-servants or sizars. Vacancies in the roll
of scholars were to be filled by an annual election
held at Michaelmas on the result of a two days’
examination. Bachelors of arts and those insane
or suffering from contagious disease (a curious conjunction)
were ineligible: also there could not, at
any one time, be more than three scholars from any
one county. The regulation that a bachelor was
not eligible for election to a scholarship suggests
that a candidate might be in residence as an undergraduate,
though it does not exclude the candidature
of those who were not already members of the
House, but the custom (if it ever existed) of electing
non-residents had died out before 1560. The admission
of pensioners, not exceeding fifty-four in
number, was definitely recognized in 1552: of these
the master might take as his pupils four, and each
fellow one. The pensioner which every fellow
might thus receive was in addition to such scholars
as had been assigned to him as pupils, but though
scholars had tutors, the fellow responsible for a
pensioner is not explicitly described as his tutor.
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It seems that an important part of the duty of a
tutor was to see that all payments due to the
college from his pupils were made punctually.
Scholars, unlike pensioners, had definite rights.</p>

<p>The following are some of the regulations:</p>

<blockquote xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">
<p>Nemo ex discipulis sine tutore in collegio sit, qui fuerit,
expellatur. Pupilli tutoribus pareant, honorem paternum

<p>Grave offences were punishable by expulsion,

 </span></span></a>“minor offences” were liable to penalties of extreme
severity. Thus we read:</p>

<blockquote xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">
<p>Quicunque in aliqua parte officii sui negligentior fuerit,
et aliquem e magistratibus bene admonentem non audiverit,
aut insolentem se ostenderit, si ephoebus sit verberibus sin

</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The text is corrupt, but the meaning is clear. A
marginal note suggests the obvious correction that
decemdiali should be read for decennali. The deans
superintended, even if they did not inflict, corporal
punishment when it was ordered.</p>

<p>Another code of statutes was drawn up in 1554,
but was never sealed, and thus did not become
effective. I need not quote the text which, on
tutorial matters, does not differ materially from
that of 1560. The draft contains a clause to the
effect that the master of the College was not to take
more than four pensioners as his pupils, a fellow
who was a master of arts or of some superior degree
was not to take more than two, and no one else
was to take a pensioner as a pupil. The word
“two” however has been crossed out and “one”
substituted. From this it would seem that the
question of how many pensioners it was desirable
to admit was already a matter of debate.</p>

<p>In 1560 new statutes were granted to the
College, and its constitution as then settled remained
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>practically unaltered till 1861. In this code the
foundation is described as including a master,
sixty fellows, four chaplains, sixty-two scholars,
and thirteen sizars or gyps, namely, three for the
master and one for each of the ten senior fellows.
Henceforth scholars were elected annually in the
spring, from undergraduates already in residence.
By a gracious provision, whose disappearance in
1861 I regret, it was ordered that forty of the
scholarships should be specifically associated with
the name of Henry VIII, twenty with that of queen
Mary, and two with that of Thomas Allen as pre-eminent
benefactors. Pensioners and subsizars were
also admissible to the Society on conditions. If
fellow-commoners dined at the high table, as seems
likely, they may have been reckoned extra numerum.
Every student under the degree of master
of arts was required to have a tutor, thus regularizing
the position of fellow-commoners, pensioners,
sizars, and subsizars as members of the College,
and bringing them under the same rule as
scholars.</p>

<p>The regulations in point are as follows:</p>

<p>In time, serious discrepancies between the statutes
and the practice of the College grew up. Some,
but not all, of these were removed in 1844, when
the statutes were revised. The sentence above
quoted “magistris artium aut superioris gradus
unum, baccalaureis autem nullum omnino concedimus”
was then struck out.</p>

<p>In 1861 new statutes were given to the College:
these contain no mention of pensioners, but merely
prescribe that no bachelor or undergraduate shall
be without a tutor. The present statutes of 1882
similarly direct that no member of the College in
statu pupillari shall be without a tutor.</p>

<p><a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Except by accident, we have no record before
1635 of the names of the tutors of the various
students, but it is probable that at first the master
regularly entered some undergraduates as his own
pupils: certainly Whitgift did so, and so too did
some of his successors. It seems most likely also
that by 1560 it was already usual for the master
to assign a student to that fellow who was to act
as his tutor, though of course regard must always
have been paid to the wishes of a parent or guardian
in this matter. This remained the ordinary custom
for perhaps two hundred years.</p>

<p>Some information on tutorial affairs in the sixteenth
century may be gathered from an account-book
kept by Whitgift, covering parts of the years
1570 to 1576, and containing statements of the
charges he made as tutor: the names of thirty-nine
men are given. In the history of Trinity
College which I wrote for my pupils some years ago,
I published a few of these bills. I give here a few
details illustrative of the many matters with
which a tutor was then concerned.</p>

<p>The payment made to him as tutor varied in
different cases, but 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a quarter for a sizar,
10<i>s.</i> for a pensioner, and 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for a fellow-commoner
were usual sums. In a few cases there are
records of an admission-fee to the College or a fee
for entering into commons: the normal payment
<a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for this was 15<i>s.</i> for a pensioner, and 20<i>s.</i> for a
fellow-commoner—there is no mention of any such
charge in the case of a sizar. The cost of the silly
ceremony by which the senior undergraduates initiated
a freshman, known as his salting, was charged
in the bills, and varied from 8<i>d.</i> for a sizar and
1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for a pensioner to 4<i>s.</i> for a fellow-commoner.
The charge for matriculation appears to have been
4<i>d.</i> for a sizar, 1<i>s.</i> for a pensioner, and 2<i>s.</i> for a
fellow-commoner.</p>

<p>Of course the cost of the purchase of books
comes in most of the accounts. Aristotle, Plato,
Sophocles, and Demosthenes constantly appear
among Greek writers, Homer and Xenophon only
once; Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, and Lucian occur
often among the Latin authors, Livy only once.
Euripides and Horace are noticeable by their absence.
I have not observed any mathematical
books. Works by Seton and Erasmus are frequently
mentioned. Among English books we have
a prayer-book charged at 1<i>s.</i>, a service-book at
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, a bible at 9<i>s.</i>, and a testament at 2<i>s.</i> The
charge for a bible in Latin was 7<i>s.</i> and for a new
testament in Greek 2<i>s.</i> A Greek grammar cost 1<i>s.</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, or 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; a Hebrew grammar 1<i>s.</i> which
seems cheap. Paper was charged 4<i>d.</i> by the quire
and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> by the half-ream: the cost of a bundle
of pens and an inkhorn was usually 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p><a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Clothes appear to have been expensive, but
naturally the cost varied widely according to the
status of the student. Apparently at that time
the wardrobes of men were fairly extensive: the
prices of the various articles are set out in full.
I hesitate to distinguish academic gowns from other
robes, but the charge of 4<i>s.</i> to John Waring, a
pensioner, for his gown and square cap, as also the
charge of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for making a gown and hood for
Phillip Harrison, another pensioner, must, I think,
be taken to refer to academic costumes. The cost
of a surplice to Richard Therald, a sizar, was 4<i>s.</i>,
but to Henry Gates, a fellow-commoner, was as
much as 11<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i></p>

<p>As to amusements, the richer students seem to
have kept or hired horses at considerable cost.
Horse-hire to London varied from 4<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i>;
to Lincoln from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Bows and
arrows constantly appear in the bills—the price of
a bow ranging from 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> Tennis was
another popular amusement of the day. The court
stood on the site of the north end of the present
library, and the keeper of the court was regarded
as a college servant; there are no charges in connection
with the bats, balls, or use of the court.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to notice that coals were
used regularly as well as wood: they were sold at
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a sack. Candles were charged at either
<a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> a pound. Among miscellaneous things
6<i>d.</i> was charged for an hour-glass; 4<i>d.</i> for a mouse-trap;
10<i>d.</i> for a scabbard for a rapier; and 10<i>s.</i> for
a lute. A set of singing lessons cost 3<i>s.</i> and a set
of dancing lessons 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Sickness appears to have been common. In
general we have no record of the duration of illnesses,
and the charges for doctors and chemists
varied widely. The charge for plucking out one
tooth seems to have been 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, but for two teeth
the dentist reduced his charge to 1<i>s.</i> a tooth.</p>

<p>We get another aspect of student and tutorial
affairs in the next century (in 1659) contained in a
long letter from which I gave extracts in the history of
the College to which I have already referred. Robert
Creighton, pronounced Crickt-on, of Somersetshire,
a Westminster boy and a scholar of the House, was
then a candidate for a fellowship. At the time there
were in residence a good many zealots, introduced
into the Society under presbyterian or Cromwellian
auspices, and one of these, a year senior to Creighton,
was also a candidate for a fellowship. Just
before the election some of the scholars were playing
tennis in the college court when the ball by chance
struck one of them in the eye. On this Creighton
called out “Oh God, Oh God, the scholar’s eye is
stroke out,” whereon his competitor accused him
to the authorities as a profane person who took
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>God’s name in vain; and as confirmation added that
he never came to the private prayer meetings of
the students. By good luck the master was Wilkins,
afterwards bishop of Chester, who owed his
appointment more to the fact that he had married
Cromwell’s sister than to his devotion to the doctrines
of the Independents. It is clear that he disapproved
of the complaint, but he considered it
prudent to summon a meeting of the seniority to
hear the case and examine witnesses. Creighton’s
tutor, Duport (who gave us our large silver salt-cellar),
spoke up for his pupil, and thereon the
master said that the charge looked like malice,
and it did not matter much if Creighton did neglect
to go to the private prayer meetings of undergraduates
since he never failed to go to chapel and
to his tutor’s lectures. He then proposed, if we may
trust our authority, that the seniority should at
once reject the informer and his friends, and elect
to the vacant fellowships the accused and his friends,
and so it was done. Such were elections then!</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to add that public opinion in
the College was against those who trumped up this
ridiculous charge, and on the day after the election
the following notice was found on the screens.
“He that informed against Ds Creighton deserves to
have his breech kickt on.” An amusing glimpse of
life under the Commonwealth. Note that the tutor
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gave lectures to his pupils, and from the tutorial
point of view observe the esteem gained by regular
attendance thereat.</p>

<p>No obligation to take pupils seems ever to have
been imposed on fellows, though a pupil once taken
could not be transferred. This, and the fact that
scholars were elected only from students already in
residence, made it undesirable to retain any rule
to the effect that a fellow should not have more
than one pensioner as a pupil. Hence in time those
who liked tutorial work and did it well were allowed
to have more than one pensioner pupil, and gradually
the bulk of the entries came to be made under
a comparatively few tutors.</p>

<p>The average annual entry of students at Trinity
during the years 1551 to 1600 was fifty-one, during
the years 1601 to 1650 was fifty, and during the
years 1651 to 1700 was thirty-nine. During the
years 1701 to 1750, it sank to twenty-seven: this
diminution being partly due to the Bentley scandals.
During the years 1751 to 1800 the average
annual entry was thirty-seven, during the years
1801 to 1850 was one hundred and sixteen, during
the years 1851 to 1900 was one hundred and seventy-four,
and during the years 1901 to 1913 was one
hundred and ninety-nine.</p>

<p>Let us see how the men were divided among the
tutors. From April to December 1635, twenty-eight
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>students were admitted who were distributed
among seventeen tutors, of whom eleven had only
one pupil and none had more than four pupils.
Taking every tenth year thenceforward, we find that
in 1645, there were (excluding ten fellows intruded
by order of parliament) fifty-seven entries; of these
fifty-one were divided among ten tutors. In 1655,
there were fifty-three normal entries divided among
twelve tutors; in 1665, forty-three entries divided
among six tutors; in 1675, forty-nine entries divided
among twelve tutors; in 1685, thirty-four entries
divided among five tutors; and in 1695, twenty-eight
entries divided among four tutors. In 1705, there
were twenty-nine entries, of these twenty-eight
students were divided among three tutors. In 1715,
there were fourteen entries divided among six tutors;
in 1725, thirty-four entries divided among twelve
tutors; in 1735, twenty-eight entries divided among
six tutors; and in 1745, twenty-one entries divided
among eight tutors.</p>

<p>In 1755 there were only two fellows acting as
tutors, namely S. Whisson and J. Backhouse.
Thenceforth there were definite tutorial “sides,”
each under one tutor or joint tutors, a tutor being
appointed to a side when a vacancy occurred; and
every admission to the College being made on a designated
side. In effect the work of a tutor was now
regarded as being of a character which should occupy
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a man’s whole energies, and it was generally held that
a tutor, while he held office, had not, and ought not
to have, leisure during term-time for independent
work. From 1755 to 1822 there were two sides. In
1822 a third side was created. In 1872 one of the
sides (being the lineal successor of Backhouse’s side)
was divided into two. These four sides are to-day
designated in the college office by the letters <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>,
<i>D</i>; side <i>A</i> being that created in 1822, sides <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>
being the two made out of the successor of Backhouse’s
side, and side <i>C</i> being the lineal successor
of Whisson’s side. [In the pre-war days of 1914
side <i>A</i> was under Dr Barnes, side <i>B</i> under Mr
Laurence, side <i>C</i> under Mr Whetham, and side <i>D</i>
under Dr Fletcher.]</p>

<p>Proceeding by decades in the same way as
before, the entries on each of the two sides (denoted
by <i>C</i> and <i>BD</i>) which existed from 1755 to 1822 were
in 1755, nineteen and ten; in 1765, four and six;
in 1775, twenty-one and twenty-four; in 1785,
eighteen and twenty-nine; in 1795, twenty-nine and
seventeen; in 1805, forty-two and twenty-six; and
in 1815, fifty-one and thirty-six. From 1822 to
1872 there were three sides (denoted by <i>C</i>, <i>BD</i>, <i>A</i>):
the normal entries on these were in 1825, forty-two,
fifty-five, forty-one; in 1835, forty, forty-five, fifty-three;
in 1845, fifty, sixty-eight, forty-nine; in 1855,
fifty-three, forty-eight, fifty; and in 1865, fifty-eight,
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>nineteen, sixty. Since 1872 there have been four
sides (denoted by <i>C</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>A</i>) which were made
approximately equal: the normal entries on these
were in 1875, forty-one, forty, forty-four, forty; in
1885, forty-nine, forty-four, forty-five, forty-eight;
in 1895, forty-eight, thirty-eight, fifty, fifty-one; and
in 1905, fifty, fifty-three, fifty, fifty-seven.</p>

<p>Until 1755 the number of pupils in residence in
any one term assigned to an individual tutor was
not large, and a tutor interested in any particular
aspect of a subject likely to be studied was generally
available: hence it was usually possible for a tutor
to give personally the teaching and guidance required
by his pupils. There were then no lecture-rooms
in College, so probably all instruction was
given in the tutor’s rooms and was informal in
character. With the establishment in 1755 of
sides, this system of teaching required modification,
and in the course of the latter half of the eighteenth
century it became the custom for a tutor to supplement
his teaching by the services of another fellow
or other fellows. These officers, known as Assistant-Tutors,
were appointed and paid by individual
tutors; they lectured regularly, took an important
part in the life of the Society, and occupied a recognized
position.</p>

<p>A marked development of the system of formal
lectures is indicated by the erection in 1835 of a
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>block of four large and four medium-sized lecture-rooms.
No other important changes were made
for another thirty years, and until 1868 instruction
remained normally organized by sides; indeed it
was only by arrangement that lectures on one side
were open to men on the other sides, though in
fairness it must be added that an arrangement for
throwing them open was made as a matter of course
whenever it seemed desirable. The retention to so
late a date of appointments by sides was due to the
fact that the finances of the four sides were then
kept as separate accounts.</p>

<p>This scheme, clumsy and illogical though it was,
might have worked fairly well as long as the great
majority of honour men read nothing but mathematics,
classics, and perhaps theology, but it was
condemned by the fact that the authorities allowed
it to be superseded in practice by an elaborate
system of private tuition paid for by the individual
students. With the introduction of new
subjects (like law, history, and various branches of
science) and the development of the corresponding
triposes, it became necessary to recast the scheme
of teaching if adequate college instruction on such
subjects was to be provided. The earliest appointment
of a college lecturer (as contrasted with an
assistant-tutor nominally attached to a particular
side) was made in 1868, his lectures being open to all
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>students of the Society, and his stipend not charged
on the funds of a particular side. This was soon
followed by the placing of all educational appointments
and finance in the hands of the College without
regard to sides; and shortly afterwards the lecture-room
accommodation was considerably extended.</p>

<p>About this time a further step was taken by
throwing most of the advanced lectures open to
members of other colleges. Thus in a few years
instruction by tutorial sides was replaced by college
lectures and class-work, and then this, to a large
extent, by teaching organized on a university basis,
supplemented by individual and catechetical instruction
in college: with this, the custom of using
private tuition has largely disappeared. Ultimately
the title of assistant-tutor was dropped; the
last appointment under that title was made in 1885,
but from about 1870 we may say that practically
the duties of an assistant-tutor were those of a
lecturer. Thenceforth tutors also took their share
of lecturing on subjects connected with their own
lines of study, and did not confine their instruction
to their own pupils, though for a year or two lectures
on elementary mathematics and classics to freshmen
on each particular side survived as a historic curiosity.
These changes led to the existing scheme
under which tutorial and tuition duties are separated,
and thus the giving of direct instruction to
<a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his pupils is not now necessarily part of the duties
of a tutor.</p>

<p>The sequence of tutors on each side has been
published, and I am sorely tempted to add various
anecdotes on the way in which some of these officers
fulfilled their duties, but such additions lie outside
the object of this essay.</p>

<p>Of course during this long period there have
been bad as well as good tutors, but I think everyone
will admit that on the whole the system has
worked well. Its special characteristic is a personal
relation between the tutor and the pupil, materially
strengthened by constant intercourse and by the
fact that practically all the correspondence with
the parents of the pupil passes through the hands
of the tutor: experience shows that the tutorial
influence has not been weakened by the fact that
in most cases direct instruction is now given by
other lecturers.</p>

 /><small>THE WESTMINSTER SCHOLARS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">The</span> relations between Trinity College and Westminster
School have always been of an intimate
character. Under the Elizabethan statutes
of the two foundations a limited number of boys
from the school were entitled, if duly qualified, to
election to scholarships at Trinity, and later an
attempt was made to extend the privilege to fellowships.
The whole matter is now one of ancient
history, but it may be interesting to put on record
some of the facts connected with it.</p>

<p>The school at Westminster owes its foundation
to queen Elizabeth. Of course the abbey
is many centuries older, and in a sense so is the
school, for a grammar-school (in addition to the
choir-school) had been attached to the medieval
monastery, though doubtless it existed only at the
pleasure of the monks. When Henry VIII created
the diocese of Westminster with the former abbey
as its cathedral, he also established a school connected
with it. The diocese soon disappeared, and
later the church and buildings were given by queen
Mary to the Benedictines. The arrangement made
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by Mary was in turn annulled by Elizabeth, who,
shortly after her succession founded the collegiate
Church of St Peter, divided into two branches, one
ecclesiastical and the other scholastic, the whole
being placed under the rule of the dean and chapter.
Thus Elizabeth is rightly designated as the founder
of the present school, though a link with the past
has been preserved in the fact that the sequence of
headmasters dates by custom from 1540. The
buildings were divided between the two sides of the
College; for the scholastic side, one part of the
monastic dormitory was made into a school-room,
the granary was turned into a school dormitory,
and the boys were allowed the use of the refectory
for meals.</p>

<p>The queen interested herself in the school she
had established; its connection with particular
colleges at the universities was suggested by the
precedents of Winchester and Eton, and it was
natural that she should desire to associate it closely
with the Houses at Cambridge and Oxford which
had been founded by her father. There is some
reason to think that the details of the arrangement
made were due to Bill, the first dean of Westminster,
who was at the same time master of Trinity and
provost of Eton; a fortunate pluralist!</p>

<p>On 29 March 1560, Elizabeth gave new statutes
to Trinity College, Cambridge, and in statute 13,
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dealing with the sixty-two scholars of the College,
she directed as follows:</p>

<blockquote xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">
<p>Sumantur autem potissimum et eligantur ex eorum
numero, si modo idonei et ceteris pares reperiantur qui
Schola Regia Westmonasterii educati ... <span class="nw">sint....</span> Ex aliis
regni partibus ac locis indifferenter ad numerum supplendum
qui maxime idonei videbuntur, semper sumantur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">In June 1560, she gave statutes to the Collegiate
Church at Westminster, and in statute 6, dealing
with the forty scholars of the school, she directed
that three scholars from the school should be elected
annually to the foundation of Christ Church,
Oxford, and three to that of Trinity College, Cambridge.
It is said that the queen did not ratify these
statutes. Be this as it may, in the following year,
on 11 June 1561, she sent to Trinity College letters
patent referring to the Westminster statutes as
indicating her wishes in the matter, and expressing
her desire that the Society should select as many
scholars from Westminster as was possible. This
then was the position in 1561, and it was
recognised these letters were binding and conferred
rights on duly qualified Westminster scholars.</p>

<p>Throughout the three centuries of the existence
of these rights, candidates usually preferred the
Christ Church studentships, which, being tenable
under certain conditions for life, were much more
valuable than Trinity scholarships, since the latter
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ran out in less than seven years. Perhaps too the
boys were attracted to Christ Church rather than to
Trinity by the fact that there they formed a larger
proportion of the whole Society than in Henry’s
foundation by the Cam. Further a boy elected to
Christ Church entered sooner into the emoluments
of his studentship than a boy elected to Trinity—the
latter not being admitted to his scholarship
until the next annual election of scholars which took
place in the following spring, usually some six
months after he had commenced residence.</p>

<p>There were only forty scholars at Westminster
and a provision for the election from them every
year of six scholars to the two universities was
more than ample. Thus in 1561 one scholar was
elected to each university, during each of the six
following years, 1562–67, two scholars were elected
to each university, in 1568, six scholars were for
the first time presented, and each university took
three. In 1569 the school again presented three
boys for election at Trinity, but the master,
Whitgift, refused to elect more than two, alleging
that there were not vacancies in the House for
more than that number. Thereon the scholar or
his friends appealed to Sir William Cecil, the chancellor
of the University. Correspondence ensued,
but the Society refused to give way on the particular
election. On the general question the College
<a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>addressed a letter<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn18" id="fna18" name="fna18">18</a></sup>, dated 3 July 1569, to Cecil
entreating him to interpose with the queen to lighten
the burden imposed on Trinity by the royal statutes,
and asserting that the Westminster scholars
took up so many places as to act to the detriment of
other and more worthy students. The crown assented
to this proposal, and it was agreed that thenceforth
three scholars should be chosen every third year, and
not necessarily more than two in the other years.</p>

<p>This arrangement lasted but a short time, for a
year or two later, perhaps in 1575, Goodman, dean
of Westminster, petitioned<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn19" id="fna19" name="fna19">19</a></sup> the lord treasurer to
confirm or re-enact the original statutes whereby
three Westminster scholars were to be elected each
year to each of the two universities. The petition
was granted, and, I conjecture, was the occasion of
the letters patent sent by the queen on 7 February
1576, to Trinity College, Cambridge, and Christ
Church, Oxford, wherein she repeated and explained
her former injunctions. In these letters she stated
that Westminster scholars were not to be allowed to
remain at the school after attaining the age of
eighteen, and in regard to their coming to one of
the universities she directed:</p>

<blockquote xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">
<p>Quamvis cupimus plurimos e nostris Discipulis Westmonasterii
ad Academias in dicta Collegia quotannis
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>promoveri, tamen ne incertus sit omnino numerus, sex ad
minimum, videlicet, tres in Ecclesiam Christi Oxonii et
tres in Collegium Trinitatis, singulis annis, si aut tot loca
vacua ... aut tot idonei e nostris Discipulis Westmonasterii
reperti fuerint, admitti volumus; Plures autem
optamus, si ita praefatis Electoribus commodum videbitur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, however, the former custom of electing
three scholars every third year and two scholars in
each of the other years continued until 1588 after
which it became usual, though the custom was not
invariable, to elect at least three scholars to each
university each year. During the forty-seven years
from 1561 to 1607 inclusive, one hundred and
thirteen scholars in all were elected from Westminster
to Trinity, of whom forty became fellows.</p>

<p>In 1603 James I came to the throne. He interested
himself in the school and was prepared to
intervene in its interests or what he regarded as
such. The earliest case of difficulty in the new
reign occurred at the election in 1604 when the
king directed the master of Trinity, Nevile, to whom
in fact he was under some obligations, to take a
boy, by name Albert Moreton, as one of the scholars
of Trinity<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn20" id="fna20" name="fna20">20</a></sup>. The boy was ignorant, and Nevile
politely but definitely refused to accept him. The
matter was not urged further, and though on some
occasions later the Trinity electors consented under
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pressure to alter the order in which candidates were
elected, their right to reject on the ground of ignorance
was not again disputed. Three years later,
the College was faced by a more serious question
concerning its connection with Westminster.</p>

<p>In 1607, James I addressed letters patent to
Trinity College, in which after referring to the letters
patent already mentioned, he ordered them to be
strictly observed, and intimated that thereafter
the scholars of Trinity should be taken chiefly from
Westminster school if duly qualified. He then continued
that he observed that the scholars who had
been elected to Christ Church were notable for their
learning and subsequent distinction, and regretted
that this was not so in the case of the scholars
elected to Trinity, a fact which he attributed to
their want of succession to fellowships and to their
leaving the University as soon as they had taken the
degree of master. Accordingly he ordered that
Westminster scholars at Trinity who had taken the
bachelor’s degree should, unless deficient in learning
or good conduct, be promoted to fellowships in preference
to other candidates. He further ordered
that any Westminster scholar in the College, who
had not been admitted to a fellowship before taking
a master’s degree, might remain resident an additional
two years during which time he should be
eligible to a fellowship, subject to lawful exceptions.
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The letters are dated 27 June 1607, but it would
appear that they were not presented until September
of that year.</p>

<p>Deep resentment was felt at this order, for
Trinity attached great importance to the desirability
of electing as fellows the best candidates,
though it was admitted that candidates from places
where the House had property had statutable
claims for special consideration. The College took
immediate steps to protect itself, and in support of
its position addressed to the chancellor of the University,
the earl of Salisbury, a petition accompanied
by a reasoned memorandum. These documents
are not dated, but I think may be assigned
to the Michaelmas term, 1607.</p>

<p>The petition is briefly to beg the chancellor to
assist the College in obtaining a review of the
letters patent with the object of maintaining its
ancient privileges and former liberties; the letters
patent being said to be contrary to the intentions
of its founder, and to its statutes<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn21" id="fna21" name="fna21">21</a></sup>. The wording
is humble and courtly.</p>

<p>The memorandum that accompanied the petition
is more outspoken. It is long, but it is so interesting
that I shall venture to quote from or describe it at
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>length. I conjecture that it was composed by
Nevile. It contains fourteen assertions or arguments
to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parnumber">1.</span> It is inconvenient that so large a College as Trinity
should be restrained unto a particular School, and it can
be easily shown that other Schools have furnished Trinity
with students of much better hope and proof than Westminster
hath done or is likely to do, for the whole number
of Westminster boys who are eligible to both Universities
are but forty, and there are seldom more than eight or nine
candidates for the six vacancies at the two Universities.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">2.</span> To alter or subvert the ancient liberties of one of
the chiefest Colleges in Christendom and to divert from the
uses intended by his Majesty’s Predecessors a foundation
like Trinity in order to satisfy private humour or under
the pretence of benefitting an ordinary School is a great
indignity to his Majesty’s Sacred Person, Power, and
Prerogative.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">3.</span> The suggestion that boys coming to Trinity do not
become Fellows, Doctors, Deans, and Bishops as do boys
entering Christ Church is untrue, frivolous, and unfair: it
is untrue, because, in fact, of the existing sixty Fellows of
the College, more than one-sixth have come from Westminster,
and at Trinity the custom is to prefer the worthy:
it is frivolous, for the fact of a man having once been at
school at Westminster is not the cause of his advancement
to the position of a Doctor, Dean, or Bishop: and it is unfair,
“for although Christ Church in Oxford be a most magnificent
and royal foundation, and hath bred in all ages as learned,
wise, and worthy prelates as the kingdom hath, yet
Trinity College in Cambridge hath had no less royal
founders, and if we fail in our Westminster brood (as
otherwise I hope we do not) either the defect hath been
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in themselves or else (which rather we suppose) it may
be imputed to those good means the other College hath,
being also a Cathedral Church and having Cannons both
richly beneficed and highly dignified which doth enable
them to Doctorships, Deaneries, and Bishopricks—a great
blessing of God that our poor College wanteth.”</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">4.</span> “Howbeit in that kind of fruitfulness we also are not
destitute of God’s gracious blessing; for ... besides Doctors
in all faculties to the number at the least of sixty, Deans to
the number of eleven, Publick Professors to the number of
ten, the two Archbishops, Canterbury and York, the most
Reverend Fathers Whitgift and Hutton, and seven other
principal Prelates of this kingdom, namely, Fletcher of
London, Still of Bath and Wells, Babington of Worcester,
Redman of Norwich, Rud of St Davids, Bennet of Hereford,
and Gouldesborough of Gloucester, all of them simul et
semel Bishops of this kingdom ... are such a demonstrative
instance as we think no other College in either University
can afford the like—and not one of these chosen out of
Westminster School.”</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">5.</span> “It is to be doubted whether there can be the like
success if our Elections out of a private School shall be
indubitate and certain; we rather think there can be no
readier means to make Droanes and Loyterers in Colleges,
nor any worse prejudice or more deadly bane unto learning
and vertue, then when the rewards, and means thereof are
tyed to persons, times, and places, and made regular and
certain.”</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">6.</span> The proposal would do a grave injustice to other
students who might be men of great abilities.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">7.</span> The proposal would defeat the express wishes of
Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, all of whom
are to be reckoned as founders as well as benefactors of
Trinity College.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber"><a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>8 and 9.</span> The proposal would be contrary to the existing
statutes of the College, and to the oaths taken by the Master
and Fellows on admission.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">10.</span> Preferences of this character are injurious to the
particular School, the College, and the whole University,
and a constant source of discord and contention.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">11.</span> “It is also against the Policy and common-wealth of
a kingdom to restrain and abridge places and preferments
originally meant, founded, and hitherto with good success
employed for the common benefit of that kingdom to a
private School: for benefits and privileges are to be
amplified and not restrained; publick rewards are not to
be applied to private places, purposes, or respects.”</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">12.</span> Interference with the intentions and directions, of
previous benefactors is contrary to public policy, and tends
to prevent future benefactions.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">13.</span> This implies that Nevile had accepted the office of
master of Trinity College under promises which rendered it
inequitable that the college statutes should, during his tenure
of the post, be altered against his wishes, but it is stated that
this argument, though noted, is not to be pressed.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">14.</span> This raises some technical points, especially as to
whether statutes of a College given under the great seal
can be varied by letters patent without explicit reference
to the clauses altered or repealed.</p>

<p>The memorandum concludes with a request that the
College may have liberty to ask the opinion of the Judges
on the questions raised, and thus obtain the benefit of the
king’s “most equal just and princely laws.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of the personal pronoun in one or two
cases and the reference in the thirteenth paragraph
to Nevile suggest that the document was composed
by him. I cannot find out anything about the result
<a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the petition, but I conjecture that nothing came of
it. Nevile however was not inclined to let the matter
rest, and no doubt the esteem felt for him at court
and his personal popularity were of great assistance
to the Society in the negotiations that followed.</p>

<p>It was a few months later, in May 1608, at
the annual election of scholars at Westminster that
Nevile took the next step in defence of the college
position. The following account of the election is
based on a paper preserved at Westminster:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Master of Trinity College (Nevile) refused to take
the oath which was required, previously to the election, by
the Law of the land as well as by the local Statutes. He also
refused to elect to his College the three Scholars ordered by
the Letters Patent of the Crown. The oath however was
taken by the Dean of Westminster (Neile) and the Dean of
Christ Church (King), as well as by their assistants, and by
the Master of the School (Ireland). The Dean of Westminster
then demanded, in writing, that the election should
proceed; when the Master of Trinity College referred to some
composition by which he stated he would be governed. To
this the Dean of Westminster replied, that he knew of no
such composition, and that, if it had existed, it was necessarily
set aside by the Letters Patent of Queen Elizabeth
and of His Majesty; whereon the Master of Trinity College
observed, though with much protestation of his loyalty,
that he did not allow the validity of the Letters Patent.</p>

<p>The other Electors, however, having agreed to proceed,
the nine Scholars who had been examined were called in to
hear the Statute read for the election to the two Colleges.
The Master of Trinity then said that he had not places
<a name="png.068" id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>enough vacant in his College. [In fact in April he and the
Seniority had filled up all scholarships then vacant and pre-elected
men to succeed to scholarships as vacancies occurred.]
To this it was replied, that the want of vacancies
had been occasioned by pre-elections of supernumerary
Scholars, that the words of the Statute were disjunctive,
and there was a clause commanding such Scholars to be
received if they were fit. The Master of Trinity College did
not deny the fitness of the candidates, but still refused to
elect. In this wrangling the whole morning was wasted.</p>

<p>At length they went to dinner. After this, a fear having
been expressed, that this “distraction” might become troublesome
to their friends, “perhaps to His Majesty,” and “not
without some obloquy” to themselves, the Master of Trinity
College proposed a private settlement, naming October for
it. The suggestion was favourably received by the Electors
other than the Dean of Westminster. The latter however
affirmed, that with his consent less than three Scholars
should never be taken by Trinity College and three by Christ
Church if the School produced so many fit Scholars: and
as to that part of the Letters Patent, which related to the
election of Westminster Scholars at Trinity College to
Fellowships, he required that they should be taken in preference
to others, if their qualifications were equal; stating
at the same time, that the clause declaring them eligible to
Fellowships two years after their degree of A.M. had arisen
solely from the practice of pre-electing so many Fellows,
that for three or four years together no election took place;
and the Westminster Scholars at Trinity College were driven
out to seek a better fortune elsewhere. The Master of
Trinity College allowed that the practice of pre-elections
was wrong; and it was at length agreed that if this were
discontinued, that part of the King’s Letters concerning the
eligibility of Westminster Scholars two years after their
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>degree of A.M. should not be urged against the local statute
of Trinity College, <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">De Gradibus Suscipiendis</cite>. Thereupon
the Master of Trinity College took for his College as Scholars
three candidates, to wit, Hacket, Shirley, and Herbert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The three scholars so taken obtained fellowships
in due course, Hacket became chaplain to James I,
Charles I, and later to Charles II, suffered cruel
persecution under the commonwealth, and at the
restoration was made bishop of Lichfield: the
Bishop’s Hostel was erected at his cost. An incident
in Shirley’s career is chronicled below (see p. 223).
Herbert was the well-known poet and divine. If the
above account is reliable, and there is no reason to
doubt its accuracy, the most important question
in dispute, namely the preferential right of Westminsters
to election to fellowships at Trinity, was left
open. Nevile however had no intention to allow the
matter to drop, and having made his protest at Westminster,
he now secured the good services of his
friend and Cambridge contemporary, Richard Bancroft,
archbishop of Canterbury, who undertook to
act as mediator in drawing up a “friendly and full”
settlement of the question.</p>

<p>An agreement, drafted I feel confident by Nevile,
was submitted to the archbishop and, after he had
made a few alterations, was accepted by the dean
and chapter of Westminster. The seniority of
Trinity College, on 5 September 1608, passed a
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>minute that the matter “be referred to our Master
against the 13<sup>th</sup> of October,” and the deed is so
dated, but its execution must have been delayed
since there is a minute of the seniority, 8 December
1608, ordering that the composition with Westminster
should be engrossed and sealed at the audit
so as to be delivered before 1 February 1609.</p>

<p>The deed embodying this agreement was made
between the dean and chapter of Westminster and
Trinity College, and provided that the College
should take yearly three scholars from Westminster
School to be scholars of the College, and that there
should be no pre-elections of supernumerary fellows
to the prejudice of the Westminster scholars if deserving
of fellowships. In consideration of these
definite obligations the dean and chapter of Westminster
agreed that the letters patent of 1607 should
never be urged against the College by the dean and
chapter or the schoolmaster or ushers or scholars
of Westminster, and that the College should have
such full power to elect fellows as had been previously
enjoyed, excepting only the practice of pre-elections.
To the deed is appended a statement
that it was made with the privity and approbation
of the archbishop of Canterbury, the earl of Salisbury
(lord high treasurer of England and chancellor
of the University of Cambridge), and of the earl of
Northampton (the lord privy seal), all of whom signed
<a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it. This conclusion of the affair may be regarded
as a personal triumph for Nevile.</p>

<p>The arrangement was submitted to the king
who in a letter directed to the College approved it,
but required that the Westminster scholars each
year should be granted seniority over other scholars
of Trinity of their year and not be hindered by pre-elections:
he did not however withdraw or rescind
the previous letters patent. I have never seen the
text of this letter but its contents are indisputable,
and there are various subsequent references to it.
The obligation to allow this seniority to the Westminster
scholars was henceforth recognized by the
College as binding on it.</p>

<p>The advisers of Trinity seem to have been doubtful
whether it would be admitted that this second
letter implied the rescission of the letters of 1607,
and since there was every reason to avoid raising the
question whether royal letters or mandates could be
set aside or modified by private arrangements, it was
wise to let matters run on as long as the agreement of
1608 was carried out by the school authorities. There
is however a memorandum, ascribed to January 1610
in the State Papers, showing that “the recent grant
by the King for the students of Trinity College,
Cambridge, to be chosen from the Westminster
scholars is prejudicial to the interests of Trinity,”
which seems to imply that further negotiations took
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>place. I have not seen the memorandum and know
nothing more about this than here appears.</p>

<p>During the sixteen years following this settlement,
that is, from 1608 to 1623 inclusive, fifty-eight
scholars were elected from Westminster to
Trinity, of whom sixteen became fellows.</p>

<p>In 1623–24 a fresh dispute occurred. It would
appear that while Trinity carried out its undertaking
relating to the election of scholars from Westminster,
it again began to pre-elect fellows with the object,
it was said, of preventing any claim being made on
behalf of the Westminster scholars in residence.
Whether this was done in self-protection against
unjustifiable claims or was a deliberate breach of
the agreement of 1608 we do not know. An appeal
to the crown on behalf of the school ensued, and on
7 September 1623, the king sent letters patent to
the College as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trusty and well beloved we greet you well. Being much
interested in the prosperity and well-fare of that our College
which is both our immediate Foundation and the fairest in
all our kingdoms, and furnished, for the most part with the
extracions of our own free-school at Westminster, we cannot
but be very sensible of any alteration in the government of
the same.</p>

<p>Whereas therefore we are given to understand that
younger students of that College have of late years been
totally disheartened in their studies by a new and unwarrantable
device of pre-electing more Fellows than there
are places vacant at the time of that Election and the
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Scholars of our own School (in whose loyalty and affection
we are so much interested from their cradles) strangely discouraged
and disgraced by being cast in their seniority
behind all the Scholars and Fellows in their several Elections
though never so exceeding in learning and education, we
straightly will and require you that from this time forward
ye do forbear all manner of pre-elections whatsoever as the
pest and bane of all learning and succession; and that also
you bear that regard and respect to the Scholars of that our
own Royal School in giving them in all such elections respect
and precedency which we are informed they fully deserve
before all other of what country soever. Lastly, whereas we
are given to understand that heretofore a corrupt custom
hath crept into that our College of turning elections into
particular nominations of the Master and the several Seniors
which smells altogether of partialitie and corruption we do
straightly will and require you the said Master of our College
of whom we conceive a very good opinion, to see that
hereafter all elections as well of Scholars as of Fellows
be done according to the local statutes of your College
and carried about with that pluralitie of voices therein
required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What reply (if any) the College made or could
make I do not know, but presumably the answer
was not satisfactory as these letters were followed by
the appointment of royal commissioners to enquire
into the Westminster elections. There is extant
a letter from the master of Trinity (Richardson)
dated 9 June 1624, to one of the commissioners,
asking to be excused from attending the usual
election of Westminster scholars, on account of
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>poor health. Probably this was regarded as an
impertinence, and he must have been reprimanded
since we have a letter dated 26 June signed by the
master and six of the senior fellows, deprecating
the royal displeasure, offering the most humble
submission, promising to obey in anything that his
majesty might command, but begging that present
compliance might not be drawn into an example
against the College. Richardson and James I died
in March 1625, and the enquiry seems to have been
then dropped.</p>

<p>The election in 1636 was interesting. It is said
that among the candidates was Cowley who had
already written various poems and a comedy showing
distinct ability. The story runs that the boy failed
badly in grammar, and the Trinity electors, insisting
that this was conclusive, rejected him as a Westminster
scholar, but offered him an ordinary scholarship
at Trinity, which he accepted. Against this
are the fact that he had been entered at Trinity as a
pensioner in April, a few weeks before the election at
Westminster, and the improbability that the electors
would have drawn such a distinction between Westminster
and other scholars of the House. Still old-time
anecdotes are not to be lightly rejected: at any
rate Cowley came into residence in due course and
was made a scholar in the same term as the four boys
taken from Westminster by the electors, these five
<a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>students being the only scholars elected by the
College in 1637.</p>

<p>During the seventy-seven years from 1624 to
1700 inclusive, three hundred and fifty-six scholars
were elected from Westminster to Trinity, of
whom one hundred and twenty-six became fellows.
During the fifty years, 1701 to 1750, out of one
hundred and eighty-seven Westminster scholars at
Trinity sixty-two became fellows; during the fifty
years, 1751 to 1800, out of one hundred and eighty,
thirty became fellows; and during the fifty-six years,
1801 to 1856, out of one hundred and seventy, four
became fellows. Throughout this long period the
friendly relations between the College and the school
suffered no change.</p>

<p>In 1727 there was a curious echo of the controversy
of 1607. A strange suggestion had been
made, apparently with the tacit approval of the
authorities of Westminster, that new statutes
should be given to Trinity constituting the dean
and chapter of Westminster Visitors of the College,
and it was decided by the advocates of the movement
to open the campaign by asking the dean of
Westminster to call the attention of the master of
Trinity (Bentley), to the “Letters Anno Quinto
Jacobi Primi.” Bentley replied on 5 March 1727,
denied their validity and argued that even if originally
valid, they could not be pressed after more
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>than a century during which time “they had never
been acted upon”: he added that, if antiquated
letters were still binding, there were various matters
in which he had powers, whose exercise might
prove singularly inconvenient to those who had
raised the question. This was really conclusive,
but further consideration had shown the inherent
weakness or folly of the original idea, and the
chapter was wise enough to proceed no further
with the matter.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, probably at the following
election at Westminster, Bentley is said to have referred
to the dean’s communication, and remarked
that the authority of the letters of 1607 would
doubtless have seemed stronger, at any rate to
the dean’s predecessor (Atterbury), if not to the
chapter, could they have been described as “Anno
Primo Jacobi Tertii”—an irrelevant remark, but
it carried a sting, for Atterbury’s devotion to the
cause of the Pretender was deeply resented by the
government.</p>

<p>From an unknown date until the early years
of the nineteenth century, Westminster scholars at
Trinity were allowed the privilege of wearing academic
gowns of a cut different from those of other
undergraduates and further distinguished by having
on the sleeves a violet button with a silk loop. The
gowns of all pensioners in the University were then
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>black and (except for those worn by Westminsters)
cut to a common pattern. The Westminster distinction
was discontinued when the present system
of different gowns for different Colleges was introduced.</p>

<p>During the first half of the nineteenth century
the numbers in the school fell seriously, and well-founded
complaints were made about the standard
of scholarship attained by the scholars elected to
the universities. In 1856, as the result of negotiations,
initiated by Whewell, the arrangements with
Trinity were completely recast, and it was agreed
on 5 December 1856 that the school should abandon
the right of Westminster boys to election to scholarships
at Trinity, and that in filling up open emoluments
in Trinity, former Westminster boys should
enjoy no preference. In consideration of this release,
the Society undertook to establish at its
own cost, exhibitions, not more than three to be
awarded each year, for boys elected from the
school who were otherwise qualified for admission
to the College; every such exhibitioner, if so
deserving, to be eligible for a college scholarship
tenable with the exhibition. This was approved by
the queen in council on 25 June 1857. It was further
agreed that the Westminster exhibitioners were to
be placed on the same footing as exhibitioners
elected by open competition before commencing
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>residence. The mode of election is settled by the
school statutes, but it would seem that the Trinity
electors have no right to demand intellectual attainments
beyond those required at the time for admission
to the College. The exhibitions are not now
confined to scholars of the school.</p>

<p>So ends the story of Westminster Scholars at
Trinity College, Cambridge. During the two hundred
and ninety-six years from 1561 to 1856 inclusive,
one thousand and sixty-four scholars had
been elected from Westminster to Trinity (or say
3.6 a year), of whom two hundred and seventy-eight
(or say one in four) had become fellows. In conclusion
I may add that in 1869 in virtue of the
powers given by the Public Schools Act, 1868, the
dean and chapter of Westminster, the dean of
Christ Church, Oxford, and the master of Trinity
College, Cambridge, created a new Governing Body
in whom the governance of the school has been since
vested.</p>

 /><small>THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY
TO UNDERGRADUATES.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">This</span> is an account of a famous struggle some
eighty years ago between the authorities and
the undergraduates of Trinity College on the subject
of attendance at chapel. The story is not to the
credit of the authorities, but, for what it is worth,
here it is.</p>

<p>There is a prelude to it concerned with a controversy
in 1834 between Thirlwall, later the statesman-bishop
of St David’s, and Wordsworth, then
master of the House, which raised the question of
the advisability of compelling undergraduates to be
present at religious services in College. At that
time regular attendance at chapel was required—as
for centuries previously it had been—from all
students as a matter of discipline, and the rule in
force on the subject was embodied in a college order
of 22 April 1824, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed by the Master and Seniors that every Undergraduate
not having an aegrotat or dormiat do attend
Morning Chapel five times at the least in every week, or
four times at the least including Sunday; and the same
number of times in the Evening, under penalty that the
week in which anyone shall not have so attended be not
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reckoned towards keeping the Term of such Undergraduate—unless
such omission be repaired by extra attendance the
week following.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Absentees were punished, and those who offended
frequently were liable to expulsion.</p>

<p>Until the era of the Reform Bill some regulation
like this was accepted as a matter of course, but
when, in that period of enquiry, all things were put
to the proof, doubts as to its wisdom began to be
voiced. In 1834 Thirlwall, then assistant-tutor to
Whewell, in an open letter dated 21 May, while
advocating the admission of dissenters to the University,
lamented the constant repetition in college
chapels of a mechanical service, believing the
practice to be detrimental to the interests of religion:
he further expressed the opinion that attendance
at chapel services should be voluntary.
He referred to a then recent statement by Wordsworth
in which the latter had said “the alternative
is not here between compulsory religion (as it is
called) and any other religion, but between compulsory
religion and no religion at all,” and on
this remarked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot indeed draw such delicate distinctions as my
friend seems to make in this passage; for as the epithet
compulsory applied to religion appears to me contradictory,
the difference between a compulsory religion and no religion
at all is too subtle for my grasp. But if for <em>religion</em> we substitute
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the word <em>service</em>, which would probably better express
his meaning, then I should quite agree with him, that, in
this case, a voluntary service would soon be changed into
no service at all: that is, the persons who are now compelled
to attend, if they were left at liberty, would stay away.
And this is the very reason why I think it would be better
that they should be allowed to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The argument was amplified in a second letter
dated 13 June. This was skilful enough as a piece
of dialectics though hardly likely to convince opponents.</p>

<p>That an officer of the college should express such
views and in this way was regarded by Wordsworth
as scandalous, and five days after the publication
of the first letter, without asking for any explanation,
he, with the consent or approval of Whewell
and the two deans (Thorp and Carus), removed
Thirlwall from his office of assistant-tutor. This
arbitrary act was generally resented in the Society
even by those who disagreed with Thirlwall or
thought that he had been indiscreet in his advocacy;
some too considered the act unstatutable,
but Thirlwall refused to appeal to the Visitor, and
shortly afterwards left Cambridge on his appointment,
in November 1834, by the lord chancellor,
to the important living of Kirby-under-dale in
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Two years later, in 1836, while the matter was
still a subject of debate, Carus was made senior dean.
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>He was a kindly man, leader in the University of
the school of thought associated with Simeon’s name,
but, whether rightly or wrongly, was regarded as
unsympathetic by those who did not think as he
did on religious questions. Carus detested the view
taken by Thirlwall, and far from conciliating college
opinion, which had been outraged by Wordsworth’s
action, urged the seniority (a Board consisting of
the master and the eight senior resident fellows to
which, under the Elizabethan statutes, the government
of the College was entrusted) to re-draft the
rule of 1824 and make clear or stiffen the penalties
for non-obedience. The seniority agreed, and on
7 February 1838, issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed by the Master and Seniors, that all Undergraduate
Scholars, and Foundation Sizars do attend Chapel
eight times at the least in every week, that is twice on
Sunday and once every other day; the Scholars, on pain of
losing <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">ipso facto</i> their statutable allowance for Commons,
and such additions as have since been made by the College
in the way of augmentation to the Commons, for every
week when there has been a failure of such attendance as
is above described; and the Sizars, on pain of incurring <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">ipso
facto</i> an equivalent deduction in money from their allowances.</p>

<p>Agreed also, that a like attendance be required from all
other Undergraduates; and that in case of failure, the Parties
so offending be forthwith admonished by the Deans; and
if, after such admonition, irregularity be persisted in, notice
be sent by the Dean to the Tutor, that a warning from him
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>also may timely be given: after which, if both these means
shall fail in producing regularity, the offender shall be reported
by the Dean to the Master (or, in his absence, to the
Vice-Master) to receive a formal admonition from him, in
the presence of the Dean, a record of which shall be preserved:
and finally, in all cases where such formal admonition shall
have been incurred three times, the offender shall <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">ipso facto</i>
be removed from the College, either entirely, or for one or
more Terms, according to the circumstances of the case; a
record of this sentence being also preserved.</p>

<p>Authority is given to the Deans to grant occasional leave
of absence, on special application made previously, but not
otherwise. Also on any casual failure of attendance, it is
allowed to Deans to accept (in order to make up the deficiency)
an equivalent attendance on other days during the
same week only; any failure on Sundays to be compensated
by attendance twice on other days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to college tradition, which came to me
from C. W. King, an undergraduate of the time, a
deputation of scholars, who remonstrated on the
severity of these sanctions, was informed by Carus
that attendance at chapel was not so much a duty
as a privilege, which was valued the most by those
who were oldest and therefore best qualified to form
an opinion on the subject—a boomerang argument
which obviously was dangerous unless the fellows
themselves attended chapel with the regularity
desired from undergraduates.</p>

<p>On this rebuff, certain students formed a Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Undergraduates.
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Its founders issued a notice asking whether what was
forced on undergraduates was practised by dons;
and that facts might speak for themselves, they announced
that they would issue marking-sheets showing
the attendance week by week of the fellows in
chapel. Copies of these marking-sheets were put
(surreptitiously) on the college screens, sent to
London clubs, and widely circulated. All efforts by
the deans to discover the authors or the printer
employed failed; I understand, however, that
W. J. Conybeare, G. E. L. Cotton, J. S. Howson,
C. L. Rose, and C. J. Tindal were its chief promoters,
and that the printer was Metcalfe of 9 Trinity
Street. Copies of these marking-sheets are now
very rare, but a few years ago one came into the
market which I was fortunate enough to secure.
It is bound in blue calf, stamped with the college
arms having as supporters two undergraduates in
knee breeches waving their caps, and with the motto
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Nemo me impune lacessit</i>.</p>

<p>The first sheet is for the week ending 17 February
1838, and shows the attendances, morning
and evening, of the master and the eighteen fellows
then in residence. Each of the two deans attended
ten times, but they were in a peculiar position, for it
was their duty, as the Society pointed out, to go
twice a day and therefore fourteen times in each
week. Only one of the other fellows, Perry, later
<a name="png.085" id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bishop of Melbourne, complied with the rule imposed
on undergraduates, four fellows went only
once, and four not at all. To this sheet the Society
appended the following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does then this new regulation of the Master and Seniors
proceed from any religious motive? Do they practice (<i>sic</i>)
what they force on the Undergraduates? They are very
regular in their attendance in Hall, but why are their places
vacant in Chapel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next week showed a slight improvement in
the attendances. The Society congratulated itself
on this, and in some general remarks indicated what
it expected from the fellows, copying these from
the notices on the subject issued by Carus. It
should be said that in the sheets those who were ill
or away from Cambridge, were marked with an <i>aeg</i>
or <i>abs</i>, so any such explanation of the absence of
the others from chapel was impossible.</p>

<p>In the third week the improvement continued,
and three fellows in addition to the master and the
deans complied with the rule, but this was the high
water-mark of attendance, and after all it did not
come to much. The Society expressed its gratification
at this, which it was pleased to treat as the
result of its efforts, and at the same time issued the
following notice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A prize for general regularity, and good behaviour when
in Chapel, has been instituted by the Society, who are as
anxious to reward merit as they are to punish immorality.
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>But whilst they thus wish to instil into the minds of the
Fellows those Religious feelings which, owing to a bad education,
they may possibly be without, the Society most distinctly
declare that they shall not be guided merely by an
outward show of religion. It is not, therefore, enough to
go merely eight times a week to Chapel, and when there to
utter the responses so loud as to attract attention, or otherwise
disturb the prayers of Undergraduates. Such conduct
will at all times be severely <span class="nw">punished....</span> For convenience
of those members of Trinity College now residing in London,
six copies of this publication are sent weekly to each of the
University Clubs there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the fourth week, apart from the indefatigable
Perry and the two deans, no one came up to the
prescribed standard. On this result the Society
remarked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Society regret much that during the last week great
laxity has prevailed among the Fellows in general with
regard to their attendance in Chapel. This is the more to
be lamented, as they had been for the two previous weeks
so much more regular than usual. This irregularity cannot
proceed from ill health, for they have been constantly to
Hall, although they are not compelled to go there more
than five times in each week. The Society, however, still
hopes that in the ensuing week they will be able to make a
more favourable report both of their attendance in Chapel,
as also of their good conduct when there. As was before
stated, any Fellow who shall, owing to any wine-party, or
other sufficient reason, be prevented from attending, will
be excused on sending a note previously to the Secretary of
the Society, and his absence will be counted as presence.
[The last seven words were a quotation from a note by
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Carus.] It is agreed by the Master and Seniors that all
Undergraduates do go eight times at least each week! Why
then do they not set us a better example?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These publications were widely disseminated
and led to the production of a number of epigrams
and lampoons which were scattered broadcast in
the University. The Society appended to this
sheet a note that its members had “<em>no connexion
whatever</em> with <em>any</em> of those abusive and profane
publications which have been so industriously circulated
during the last two weeks.”</p>

<p>The sheet for the week ending 17 March, announced
the success of the movement, though in
this return only Carus and Perry came up to the
standard. Appended to the sheet were the following
notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Society in laying the first list of this month before
the public, have much reason to be pleased with the success
of the work which they have undertaken, for they have
been informed, on very good authority, that the Cruelty
System will not be continued more than a week longer, but
that the Master and Seniors have determined to come to a
new Agreement about <span class="nw">Chapels....</span> If this should be the case,
the end which the Society had in view will be accomplished,
and the weekly publications will be discontinued, until called
again into life by some new act of Cruelty upon the much
enduring Undergraduates, but not otherwise. The Fellows
have been very irregular during the last week, in their attendance
at Chapel; so much so that only two of the whole
number in residence have kept the number, which the
<a name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Undergraduates are compelled to keep, on pain of being <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">ipso
facto</i> rusticated, either entirely, or for one or more terms.
And yet one Member of Trinity College was really sent away
during the past week (who had always been seven times
each week before) because he had the courage to object to
compulsory attendance at Chapel, especially from those
men who had set him such an example!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the course of the next week a printed notice
appeared on the screens reducing the number of
compulsory attendances in chapel to two on Sundays
and four during the week. The paper, type,
and setting look as if this were issued by the authorities.
I have, however, seen a contemporary letter in
which it is said that this notice was in fact a forgery:
the suggestion being that the men were tired of the
joke, and invented this way of terminating the episode.
I cannot say whether the deans modified their
rule, and the question of the genuineness of this
notice must be left undecided. It is true that no
extant minute of the seniority exists about any new
regulation, but the records of the proceedings of that
body are so imperfect that no conclusion can be drawn
from this.</p>

<p>The Society in publishing its last sheet, namely,
that for the week ending 24 March, concluded with
the following class list and notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The examination of the Fellows is now finished: and in
arranging the different classes the Secretary has attached
to each person’s name his number of marks, in order to do
<a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>away with any appearance of favour shewn more to one
than another, as is too often the case in other Examinations.</p>

<p>The Prize Medal for regular attendance at chapel and
good conduct when there, has been awarded to Mr Perry,
who has passed an examination highly creditable to himself
and family. He was only 18 marks below the highest
number which he could possibly have gained. It is, therefore,
to be hoped Mr P. will be more regular and do still
better next term. With respect to the two Gentlemen who
are not classed, the Secretary need hardly say that he does
not envy them their feelings on the present occasion. In
consequence of the New Agreement, the Chapel Lists will
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">ipso facto</i> be discontinued for the future.</p>

<p>In the above list the master is designated as
Wordsworth Senior. The prize was awarded to
Perry the future bishop, but instead of the promised
medal he was given a bible. This was secured for
the College in 1906, and now rests in our library.
It is bound in calf, stamped with the arms and
<a name="png.090" id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>supporters assumed by the Society, and bears the
inscription “From the Undergraduates of Trinity
College to the Rev. Charles Perry, M.A., as a
mark of affection and esteem for the good example
which he set them and the <em>rest</em> of the
College by his constant attendance at Chapel.”
I have been informed that to each of the two fellows
who did not attend at all there was sent a small
bible with an inscription therein of the Society’s
hope that its presence among his books might in
the future encourage him to perform tasks which he
believed to be important even though he found
them unpleasant.</p>

<p>The doggerel verses to which I have alluded as
appearing in connection with the struggle were, as
far as I have seen them, poor stuff as literary productions,
and some were highly improper. The
author of one of the worst of them was discovered
and expelled from the College, 12 March 1838.
I possess copies of four or five of these productions,
their value consists entirely in giving us stories then
current about dons and things academic—stories,
I may add, which appear generally to have had no
foundation in fact. The best set of verses, supposed
to be addressed on Saturday evening by a man to
his bedmaker, is a parody of Tennyson’s <cite>May Queen</cite>.
It begins: “You must mind and call me early—call
me early, d’ye hear? For I in morning chapel to-morrow
<a name="png.091" id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>must appear,” and on the whole runs easily.
There is nothing in these squibs which deserves remembrance
or needs any further notice here.</p>

<p>There ends the story, and no comments on it or
the actors in it are needed. It may be added as a
postscript, that for a long time subsequent to this
incident some attendance at chapel was required
from all who had no good reason to ask for exemption,
and that as time went on the requirements
gradually grew less. The question of making attendance
at chapel compulsory on those who have
not yet fully attained years of discretion is admittedly
difficult, and made more so by the fact that
while such attendance is approved and rigorously
imposed every day of the week at most public boarding
schools on lads up to the age of eighteen or nineteen,
it is regarded as unthinkable in the case of
young graduates of twenty-one or so. Trinity
College finally adopted the view advocated by
Thirlwall, and to-day attendance at chapel services
is voluntary.</p>

 /><small>THE COLLEGE CHAPEL.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">The</span> College Chapel, as it appears to-day, is
described in many of the guide-books which
are pressed on the casual traveller in Cambridge.
I am not here concerned with the accounts of it
there given, for in this paper I intend to deal with
little beyond its history and traditions.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that the
present chapel was built under the auspices of the
Tudor queens, Mary and Elizabeth, on the site
of the old chapel of King’s Hall. Let me begin
by tracing briefly the history of these successive
buildings, and their connection with college
developments.</p>

<p>King’s Hall owed its origin to the establishment
of scholars in the University of Cambridge by Edward
II in 1317, and was put on a permanent footing
by Edward III in 1337. The original home of
the Society was a large two-storeyed house, built
of wood and thatched, bought from Robert de Croyland,
and situated on the ground now occupied
by the walks and grass plot in front of the chapel.
No chapel or oratory was connected with it, and the
<a name="png.093" id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Society worshipped in All Saints’ church which
then stood on the green in Trinity Street facing
our present chapel.</p>

<p>In 1375 the College began the erection on the
ground to the north and west of its house of a
larger building comprising a cloister court with
various extensions. The west side of this court,
some hundred and twenty feet long, is still
standing and faces the bowling green: the other
three sides and the extensions have been destroyed.
These buildings were of three storeys,
built of stone, brick, or rubble, and tiled: they were
finished about 1438, and the old mansion of Robert
de Croyland was then pulled down. Into the inner
quadrangle of this cloister court there projected
from the middle of its western face a wooden
erection some fifteen feet long by fifteen feet wide,
built in 1419–24 over what is now the junior combination
room, and containing on its upper floor
an oratory which opened on to a gallery over the
cloisters on that side of the court. A list of the
service-books, plate, copes and other vestments,
altar-cloths, curtains, gold embroidery, etc., kept in
this oratory in 1479 is given in my booklet of 1917 on
King’s Hall. The building was small and the Society
continued to use All Saints’ church for its more
important services.</p>

<p>The desirability of having a chapel large enough
<a name="png.094" id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for all college purposes was obvious, and in 1464 the
Society began the erection of such a building,
on ground beyond the eastern extension of the
cloister court. This new chapel, which covered
part of the site of our present chapel, was about
a hundred feet long and thirty feet broad, that is
roughly half the length of and the same breadth
as the present chapel: it was built of stones, squared
and supplied ready for use, which according to
Caius came from the large banqueting hall of the
Castle then being pulled down and probably by
purchase from King’s College to whom these materials
had been granted. It was wainscotted, and
was fitted with stalls and carved woodwork; the
high altar, like that of the older oratory, was of
wood and the interior walls above the wainscotting
were plastered and whitewashed; the sum spent
suggests that the fittings were not elaborate. The
work was finished in 1499, but probably the chapel
was used from 1485 onwards: of course the plate,
service-books, etc., were removed to it from the
old oratory.</p>

<p>Trinity College, on its foundation in 1546,
naturally made use of this chapel, for it was the
only one available on the site<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn22" id="fna22" name="fna22">22</a></sup> of the new College.
<a name="png.095" id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It is fairly certain that it was then fitted up with
additional seats and probably redecorated<!-- TN: hyphen removed -->: the
provision of a new organ and a new lectern happen
to be specifically mentioned.</p>

<p>Edward VI ascended the throne in 1547, and
barely had the interior of the chapel of King’s Hall
been adapted to the needs of the new foundation
than the College was required to remove all popish
traces from it. The altar and steps were taken
down, and a communion table set up, most likely
in the middle of the chapel. The books, copes,
vestments, and altar ornaments which had come
down from old times were sold: they realized no
less than <i>£</i>140. 8<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and the magnitude of the
sum obtained in such unfavourable conditions shows
that the services must have been conducted with
considerable pomp. There is to-day in the library
a standing censer boat, ascribed to the end of
the fourteenth century or the early years of the
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fifteenth century, with traces on it of its ancient
gilding, but there is no record as to how or when it
came to us. King’s Hall did in fact own among its
chapel vessels a “ship of silver” which probably
means a censer boat, and it may be that this is the
vessel in question. With this possible (but doubtful)
exception all our medieval chapel plate has gone.</p>

<p>When in 1553 Mary succeeded her brother, the
Roman religion was restored, and the chapel again
adapted to the old forms of worship. Perhaps remonstrance
was made by the master, Bill, who had
been appointed in 1551 on Redman’s death and
was a strong Anglican: at any rate he was deprived
of his office. The expulsion was dramatic and apparently
physical, for as he was sitting in his stall
in the chapel two members of the House, Mr Boys
and Mr Gray, approached and “removed him ... in
a rude and insolent way.” Declining any contest
he retired to Bedfordshire, and was succeeded as
master by Christopherson, the queen’s chaplain and
confessor.</p>

<p>Mary recognized the interest taken by her father
in Trinity and, in furtherance of his design, decided
to rebuild the College on a comprehensive plan.
She issued orders about this on 24 October 1554,
and it was arranged in 1555 that the first large task
undertaken in connection with it should be the
erection of a new chapel. Preliminary work on this
<a name="png.097" id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was commenced in 1556 and it was then expected
that the building would be finished by the end of
1557, but by October of that year the walls were
only half-way up: delays ensued and ten years
elapsed before the building was completed. The
old chapel was unroofed in 1561, and cannot, it
would seem, have been used after that date: it is
possible it was shut up in the course of 1557, but
early in that year it was still in use, for the royal
commissioners in January 1557 complained of the
absence of lights on the altar and of coals to cense
the sacrament. During the years from the closing
of the old chapel to 1567 it is uncertain whether
the services were held in College or in one of the
town churches.</p>

<p>It was originally intended that the new chapel
should be a hundred and fifty-seven feet long and
thirty-three feet broad, the east end being flush
with the street frontage of the Great Gate. The
roof was to be curved, open, and relieved with fretwork
and oak pendants. There was to be an east
window, a west window, eleven windows on the
south side, and twelve on the north side from which
it follows that it was to be a detached building save
for its abutment on staircase E in the Great Court.</p>

<p>It was designed to contain two rows of stalls made
after the pattern of those at King’s College, sixty-eight
in the upper row with misereres, divided by
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pillars, and with double crests above, and a lower
row of stalls not so divided. Unfortunately the
contractor got into money difficulties and sold much
of the timber which had been bought for the intended
roof and stalls, causing the work to fall into
arrear.</p>

<p>After the accession of Elizabeth, changes in the
plans of the new chapel were made, the length being
increased to two hundred and five feet, thus making
it project beyond the east side of the Great Court.
In 1564 the walls of the building were finished and
plastered, and the date 1564 cut on the east gable
together with the text from the Vulgate, Matthew
xxi. 13, <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Domus mea domus orationis vocabitur</i>, which
in the authorized version runs: “My house shall be
called the house of prayer” and is followed by the
clause “but ye have made it a den of thieves.”
Wags have sometimes continued the inscription by
adding the second clause on the chapel either of
Trinity or of St John’s as their inclinations led them.
The roof, put on in 1565, is of a style earlier than
this date, and Willis came to the conclusion that it
is the actual roof of the old chapel of King’s Hall
supplemented by additional timber to fit it for the
larger building: I like to think that we still worship
under the roof which sheltered our predecessors
more than four centuries ago.</p>

<p>In the year last mentioned, 1565, the stones
<a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for the pavement were brought from Croyland
Abbey and maybe some are still there. In the
next year the interior fittings were taken in hand,
and the organ screen erected. In the following year,
1567, the windows were glazed with white glass
bearing inscriptions, coats of arms, and heraldic
badges such as the fleur-de-lys, portcullis, and rose:
the organ (a small instrument) and the pulpit were
moved from the old chapel, and the stalls put in.
It would seem that the wainscotting and wall-seats
in the present antechapel are of this date, and possibly
came from King’s Hall. Moving from west to
east in the completed building there were in succession
an antechapel sixty-five feet long, an organ-screen
eight feet deep, the chapel seats along some
seventy feet, a space of twenty-four feet, the communion
table, and a space of thirty-six feet free of
encumbrances. The work was finished by Michaelmas,
1567. There is no record of the building having
been consecrated.</p>

<p>Mary died in 1558, and on 20 November, the
Sunday following the proclamation of Elizabeth,
Bill, the former master of the College, preached at
St Paul’s Cross in London; the next Sunday, his
successor Christopherson preached there. Probably
the men disliked one another, and certainly
took different views of the position. Some scandal
was caused, an the upshot of the affair was that
<a name="png.100" id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Christopherson was sent to prison, while Bill returned
to Cambridge, restored to the mastership.</p>

<p>Bill, a discreet courtier, was a favourite at
court, and held, under Elizabeth’s favour, the provostship
of Eton and the deanery of Westminster
together with the mastership of Trinity; it was probably
due to his influence that Elizabeth in 1560
issued a commission to procure materials and labour
for completing the chapel which had been begun on
her sister’s initiative. Baker praised his prudence
and temper while master, and added that “if he
has shown any frailties or failings here, allowances
must be made for difficult times and potent
courtiers that are not easily resisted.” In my
opinion the services to the College of its first three
masters, Redman, Bill, and Christopherson, were
of the greatest value, and have hardly received
that recognition from posterity which they deserve.</p>

<p>On Bill’s death, the crown offered the mastership
to Beaumont, a calvinist whose views were more
pronounced than Cecil supposed at the time of the
appointment. Beaumont sympathized with the
puritan party, whose numbers in the University
were now rapidly increasing, but did little to guide
them or to check their intolerance which constantly
offended public opinion.</p>

<p>The description of the windows in the new chapel
does not suggest that figures or catholic symbols
<a name="png.101" id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>appeared thereon, but, none the less, the “malcontents”
thought them objectionable and in November
1565, broke “all the windows wherein did
appear superstition.” In the same term occurred
the famous surplice disturbance<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn23" id="fna23" name="fna23">23</a></sup>. The puritans
objected to the use of the surplice in chapel on
Sundays, Saints’ days, and their eves, and on a
certain “Sunday (in Dr Whitgift’s absence), Mr
Cartwright and two of his adherents made three
sermons on one day in the chapel so vehemently
inveighing against the ceremonies of the church
that at evening prayer all the scholars save three
[together with one of the chaplains] (viz. Dr Leg,
Mr West, Whitaker’s tutor, and the chaplain) cast
off their surplices as an abominable relic of superstition”—a
curious illustration of how little the
calvinists esteemed the value of academic discipline
unless they exercised it themselves. The organization
of this demonstration was attributed to Cartwright,
their leader in the University and a fellow of the
College; it was probably due to the disapproval of his
conduct in this and similar matters that shortly afterwards
he went out of residence for two or more years.</p>

<p>Beaumont died in 1567 and at his request was
buried “with no vain jangling of bells nor any other
popish ceremonies” in the new chapel, his being
<a name="png.102" id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the first interment in it. He is commemorated by
a carving (somewhat difficult to detect) of his face
on the tenth principal in the chapel roof reckoned
from the east end—it is lettered <i>R. B. Mr.</i> He was
succeeded by Whitgift and the result of the subsequent
bitter struggle between him and the puritans
settled the constitution and policy of the University
till the middle of the nineteenth century, but the
battle was mainly fought in the senate-house and
in London, and is not specially connected with our
chapel.</p>

<p>Alterations to the organ were made in 1594,
and elaborate hangings placed in the organ loft
in 1604. Thenceforward repairs and reconstructions
of the organ followed one another every few
years. The history of the instrument has been published
in pamphlet form, and I shall not again refer
to its successive enlargements. The west window
was blocked up about this time owing to the removal
of King Edward’s Tower to its present
position.</p>

<p>There is an account of college doings in chapel
in 1635 in the following memorandum sent to Laud,
and endorsed by him as embodying matter which
he intended to examine during an intended visit to
Cambridge in September 1636.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Trinity College, they have been long noted to be
negligent of the chapel and of prayers in it; the best come
<a name="png.103" id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but seldom, and by their example the rest make small account
of service. In some tutors’ chambers (who have three
or four score pupils), the private prayers are longer and
louder by far at night than they are at Chapel in the evening.
Some fellows are there, who scarce see the inside of the
chapel thrice in a year, nor public hall, nor St Mary’s Church,
and (they say) impugn all.</p>

<p>A quire is there founded for Sundays and holydays, but
the quiremen are so negligent and unskilful, that, unless it
be an anthem, they often sing the hymns no otherwise than
in the common psalmerie tune. And to mend the matter,
they have divers dry choristers (as they call them), such as
never could and never meane to sing a note, and yet enjoy,
and are put in to take the benefit of those places professedly.
They have a large chapel, and yet the boyes rows of pews
are placed just in the middle of the chapel, before and behind
the Communion-table, which some there are about to reform.</p>

<p>They lean, or sit, or kneele at prayers, everyone in
a several posture as he pleases. At the name of Jesus few
will bow, and when the creed is repeated, many of the
boyes, by some men’s directions, turn towards the west
door. Their surplices and song-books, and other furniture
for divine service, is very mean. The cloth that lies upon
the table not worth 14d. He that executes, steps over the
exhortation and begins, <i>Wherefore I pray and beseech you, &amp;c.</i>
They use no Litany for the most part, but in Lent
only, and in Lent only upon Sundays, and when they say
it, it is at the Communion-table. They repeat not the Creed
after the Gospel, and instead of the <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Magnificat</cite> and the <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Nunc
Dimittis</cite>, they will at pleasure (sometimes when the quiremen
are present) sing the 23rd or some other riming <span class="nw">Psalm....</span>
They have lately taken advice, and are about mending their
chapel, if it holds.</p>

<p>Fellows ... (when of the degree of M.A.) and fellow-commoners,
<a name="png.104" id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>take themselves generally to have a privilege to
miss prayers, as well as the public table of the hall. From
hence it comes to pass, that so many of that ranke are to be
founde at those times, either in taverns and towne-houses, or
at some other pleasant imployments, where they please.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether all this was true or not we cannot say,
but at any rate in the following year, 1636, the
College spent a considerable sum on alterations and
decorations in the chapel. The communion table
was removed to the east end and the ground there
raised, a pavement of stone and marble laid down,
the walls were panelled, and rich hangings provided.
Charles I, with his son the prince of Wales, visited
the chapel in March 1642, and was much pleased
therewith: we read at this time of candlesticks,
tapers, and a crucifix on the altar; other references
show that the ritual was high.</p>

<p>The next year 1643 saw a great change, for the
parliamentary party secured control of the town
and district. The order compelling the use of the
surplice on certain days was now rescinded, and
under Dowsing the chapel was purged, the altar
steps levelled, the altar taken away, and a wooden
communion table without rails set up in the middle
of the chapel; the organ and hangings were removed;
and certain figures, painted on the walls
at the east end whitewashed. The zealots did
not think the reforms had gone far enough, but
<a name="png.105" id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>no other changes were forced on the College, and
a few months later the Society made a money
present “to some of Major Scot’s souldiers who
defended the chappell from the rudenesse of the
rest.” A few years later, on 12 March 1647, Sir
Thomas Fairfax then in command of the district
came, and was received “in great state ... in the
Chapel, he was presented with a rich bible, and in
the hall with a sumptuous banquet”—a pleasant
combination.</p>

<p>At the restoration, the original altar of 1643
was recovered and replaced at the east end, a screen
of rich mosaic work erected behind it, and as far as
practicable the chapel restored to its former appearance.
Doubtless, however, practices continued which
to-day would strike us as unseemly, for I notice that
in 1665 “it was agreed that Dod have the place of
keeping the dogs out of the chapel.”</p>

<p>In the early years of the eighteenth century the
condition of the fabric caused anxiety; after only
a little more than a century’s wear the roof was
found to be in a dangerous condition, and a portion
of one of the external walls in danger of falling.
It was determined to place the building, inside as
well as outside, in thorough repair. Work began in
1706 and was nearly thirty years in progress. The
fellows and a few friends subscribed a large part of
the cost, and the rest was paid out of corporate
<a name="png.106" id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>income. In the plan adopted, which is associated
with the names of Bentley and Cotes, the east
window was blocked, and the present stalls, baldachino,
organ-screen, and wainscotting erected: the
design of the latter is excellent of its kind, though
not altogether suited to the architecture of the
building. Some of the old stalls are said to have been
removed to St Michael’s church, and the tradition
may be accepted as probable. Later in the century,
1787–88, the roof was painted in white and gold.</p>

<p>The number of residents in College in the early
half of this century was small, and probably the
chapel was in regular use during most of its restoration.
A trivial incident at this time afforded some
amusement. Complaints had been made that
Bentley—an illustrious scholar, genuinely interested
in promoting learning, but as master of Trinity
arrogant, unscrupulous, and dishonest—never went
to chapel though required to do so by the statutes.
This was true enough, and he determined to silence
his critics by appearing again. But so long had
he been absent that the door of his stall had got
fixed and could not be opened till the lock had been
wrenched off.</p>

 </span></span></a>chapel services on Saturday and Sunday evenings
in the fourth decade of the eighteenth century.
The writer says that interpolated in the evening
prayers were elaborate musical performances sometimes
involving two symphonies<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn25" id="fna25" name="fna25">25</a></sup> and two anthems
in which the choir, organ, and six violins took part;
he also repeats more than once that the building was
crowded [by strangers] and the noise so great that
little of the service could be heard. Thus, to quote
one instance, under date of 28 May 1738, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This evening I was at Trinity Colledge Chapple where
there was so great a crowd that nothing could be heard of
the whole service, I could see the Readers lips go, but, not
so much as heare the least sound of his voice, and when
Dr Walker read the 2d Leason could I only heare the sound
of his voice but not to distinguish one word. There was
great difference in the Musick part from what used to be,
for the symphony was first by the Organ and then by 6
violins in 3 parts to all which the Organ was the base. After
the reading the first and 2nd Lessons, 3 men sang the [blank]
to which the Choire was the Corus. Before the Prayer for
the King there was another Symphony by the Organ, &amp;
Violins, and the Anthem was Sung by one man, to which
the choir was likewise the chorus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout most of the eighteenth century, a
good many of the fellows resident in Cambridge held
livings in the vicinity. They were accustomed to
ride out on Sunday to their cures, hold services,
<a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and return home to a comfortable supper the same
evening, but in general neglected their parishes
during the rest of the week. Thus if a parishioner
died, the funeral was deferred till the following
Sunday; and if a marriage-service was to be held
in the village, it had to wait for a free Sunday.
In these circumstances the bride and bridegroom
often settled the matter by coming into Cambridge
for the ceremony, and during the first half of this
century our chapel was constantly borrowed for
such marriage services; after the Marriage Act of
26 George II, cap. 33, this use of it became illegal
unless a special license were obtained. Since that
Act, it has been used only once for such a purpose,
namely, for the marriage of Miss Butler on 18 December
1901.</p>

<p>Coming to the nineteenth century, we have
numerous notes about the chapel and the services.
At the beginning of this period the author of <cite>Alma
Mater</cite> (J. M. F. Wright, who commenced residence
in 1817) gives an unfavourable account of the
services, saying that they were gabbled through as
fast as possible amid a great deal of talking. The
first part of this statement may be correct, but as to
the second probably conversation was rare, and such
as took place, though not condemned by public
opinion, was subdued and was held only in recesses,
one of which was known as iniquity corner. In fact,
<a name="png.109" id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>we may take it that the vast majority of the undergraduates
acted as gentlemen though they attended
chapel reluctantly and merely as a matter of
discipline. Attendance was required at seven o’clock
in the morning, not a convenient hour, albeit considerably
later than that usual in Tudor times.</p>

<p>In 1831 the fabric was again thoroughly repaired,
the roof redecorated, certain stalls elevated,
desks at the east end constructed, and a new scheme
of lighting by candelabra introduced. A few years
later, in 1838, the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Undergraduates concerned themselves
with marking the attendance of fellows in chapel.
That incident I have described elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 1867–75 the building was again thoroughly
overhauled, the south side faced with stone, a
porch, a new vestry, and a choir-room built, the
organ screen moved a few feet westward, the walls
and roof painted, gilding used freely on the panelling,
the windows filled with stained glass, backed benches
and kneeling stools introduced for undergraduates,
and the building lighted with gas. During part of
the time occupied by this restoration, the College
used St Michael’s church as its chapel.</p>

<p>According to the scheme of decoration, adopted
on the advice of Lightfoot and Westcott, if we
proceed eastwards up the chapel we are supposed
to note, in order, the frescoes on the walls (which
<a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>represent old testament heroes and teachers) and
paintings on the roof (which illustrate the Benedicite),
leading up through Jewish history to the
birth of Christ, and then, returning westward, to
have suggested to us, by the successive windows,
the historical development of Christianity and the
growth of learning particularly in the University
and College. A man might worship many years in
the chapel before he discovered this design.</p>

<p>The panels in the sacrarium are replaced by
intarsia work in which all the woods used are of
their natural colours. The sixteenth-century silver
cross on the communion table came from Spain.
The wrought-iron gas standards here and through
the chapel are also worthy of note; fortunately
they were allowed to remain when the electric light
was introduced. All this, as well as the scheme
of decoration of the antechapel, is described in
guide-books with more or less accuracy.</p>

<p>Probably the services were never rendered more
effectively than in the years following this restoration.
Attendance on Sunday evening was required
unless absentees could urge conscientious or other
good reasons for exemption, but a large proportion
of those who might have obtained exemption did,
in fact, take part in the Sunday services. More
benches were placed in the chapel than are there
now, and the building, with every seat occupied and
<a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>everyone (save a few privileged visitors) in a surplice,
presented a most impressive scene. Electric light
was introduced in 1893, and has added much to the
comfort of congregations in winter evenings.</p>

<p>In former days members of the Society who died
in College were not infrequently buried in the
chapel—a shocking thing to permit in a building in
constant use, though sanctioned by the custom of
many centuries. There are a good many tombstones
scattered over the floor, and copies of all the
inscriptions have been published. I wonder how
many members of the Society know that among
those here buried is one woman, bearing the strange
Christian name of Elismar. The last interment in
the chapel took place in October 1886, and further
burials are now forbidden unless sanctioned by the
Home Office.</p>

<p>The building has always been used for various
secular purposes, such as elections to scholarships
and fellowships; the admission of scholars, fellows,
and officers; the affixing of the College seal to documents,
and the delivery of declamations by students.
Within recent years lectures in the antechapel
and an oration in the chapel have been delivered.
I believe the view that a church or chapel is intended
only for the performance of religious services
is modern and unwarranted by history: at any
rate our records give no authority for it.</p>


<div class="footnotes">
<p><a class="parnumber" href="#fna22" id="fn22" name="fn22" title="Back">22</a> On the site acquired for the College were situated the buildings
of King’s Hall, Michael-House, Physwick’s Hostel, and some private
hostels or boarding houses. Members of private hostels used their
parish churches. All the students in Physwick’s Hostel were members
of Gonville Hall, and used the chapel of that Hall. The
members of Michael-House used St Michael’s church: this House
had been founded in 1324 by Hervey de Stanton for a master and
six fellows, who if not priests at the time of admission, had to take
orders within one year; and later two more fellows, three chaplains,
and four bible clerks were added to the foundation, which was intended
for secular clergy studying in the University. The church of
St Michael was appropriated to it, and rebuilt by its founder for use
as its chapel. The fellows had in their House an oratory, and in
March 1393, the bishop of Ely granted them leave to build a chapel,
but their history and convenience alike made them wish to continue
to use St Michael’s church as their regular chapel.</p>

 /><small>SOME COLLEGE TREASURES.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">Those</span> who live among beautiful surroundings
and in constant touch with works of art are
often apt to take their privileges for granted.
Members of Trinity are proud of the buildings of
the College and the grounds in which they are
placed, and most of us know something of their
history and characteristic features. But with our
art treasures there is less general acquaintance, and
so perhaps it may not be out of place to jot down a
few notes on some of them—chiefly pictures and
plate—in which I take pleasure.</p>

<p>Of the contents of the library I say nothing, for
a volume would be needed to describe them even
briefly. The illuminated manuscripts and the early
printed books attract most attention, but there are
numerous other subjects in which the library must
be ranked among the most important in Great
Britain. I have often been told by undergraduates
that they have never been in the building except
once when they signed the Admission Book. That
is true enough of some men, but those who are interested
in rare and famous books and yet never
visit the Library neglect exceptional opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="png.113" id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Of oil portraits—in all nearly two hundred—of
former members of the College, we own a valuable
collection, and they illustrate in a remarkable way
how many distinguished men have been educated
here. Identification is easy as labels are placed on
most of the pictures. Unfortunately we have no
gallery in which they can be shown. Some are put
in the hall, some in the master’s lodge, some in the
combination room, and some in the library, lecture-rooms,
etc. Those in the lodge are set off well, but
the others are not hung to advantage.</p>

<p>About twenty-five years ago a proposal was made
to raise subscriptions for an art gallery to be built
along the edge of the river starting from the present
north end of the library and extending over the
land now occupied by the master’s stables and the
end of his garden. At that time the proposal did
not receive much favour, but now I sometimes
wonder if we were wise in putting the plan on one
side. Certainly we have more canvasses than we
can exhibit satisfactorily. The hall, too, would
look a more dignified apartment if the pictures,
except for one or two on the dais, were taken
away: recently their temporary removal was necessitated
by repairs to the woodwork, and the improvement
in the appearance of the room was
noticeable. The general effect of such a clearance
may be judged by a visit to the hall of the Middle
<a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Temple in London. The dimensions of the body
of that hall are the same as ours, but instead of
pictures on the side walls, each small oak panel
bears an armorial shield: these harmonise well with
the architectural lines of the building. Where, as
is the case with our neighbours at St John’s, the
panelling is low and there is above it a big stretch
of stone or painted wall, pictures add to the effect,
but this is not the case where the panelling is high.</p>

<p>Of all our pictures I suppose the one which
attracts most attention is that of Henry VIII which
hangs over the dais at the north end of the hall: it
was given us by Robert Beaumont, who held the
mastership from 1561 to 1567. The artist was Hans
Eworth, a Dutchman who lived in London circ.
1543–75, and worked with or under the influence of
Antonio Moro: the portrait was taken from or
founded on that of the king in the fresco painted
by Holbein in 1537 on a wall of the privy chamber
in Whitehall palace. This fresco, which was destroyed
in the fire of 1698 and till then deservedly
treated as one of the art treasures of London, contained
portraits of Henry VII and Henry VIII with
their queens, Elizabeth of York and Jane Seymour.
Holbein’s studies for the heads of the two kings
have been preserved, and are at Chatsworth and
Munich. Most of the extant portraits of Henry VIII
are copied from or founded on this fresco. Signs
<a name="png.115" id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of deterioration in the fresco were noticeable in the
reign of Charles II, and by his orders it was copied
by Remée, a French painter then resident in London.
The original fresco was on each side of and above
a fireplace or window. Instead of depicting this,
the artist represented this space as occupied by a
pedestal containing an inscription: his delineation
of the faces of the sovereigns is poor, but he has
preserved Holbein’s general design. Two copies of
the reproduction are extant, one of which is in the
royal collection and the other at Petworth.</p>

<p>Hardly less notable than the presentation of
our founder, and far more valuable, is the charming
portrait by Joshua Reynolds of the duke of Gloucester
(1776–1834) as a boy: the duke was a cousin
of George III and afterwards chancellor of the
University. Reynolds wrote in his diary that the
boy sat for his portrait in March 1780 when he was
four years old, and that the finished picture was
delivered in January 1788—the charge for it being
a hundred guineas. Horace Walpole praised it,
but thought it “washy,” an opinion not shared by
modern critics who esteem it one of Reynolds’s
masterpieces. The picture was left to the College
in 1843 by the will of the duke’s sister, the Princess
Sophia, with a request that it should be hung in
the hall. The legacy was due to the good offices of
a freshman of the time—the Hon. Douglas Gordon,
<a name="png.116" id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>son of George, fourth earl of Aberdeen. He described
the circumstances attending the gift as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I went up to Trinity in 1842, I used to see a
great deal of the <span class="nw">princess....</span> [I was then] a freshman full
of admiration for my College of which I used to boast.
One day the old princess shewed me the picture, ... and
asked if I thought it would look well in the Hall. On my
saying what a boon it would be, she very graciously said
“You can tell Mr Whewell that I will leave it to the College
through you, and I hope you will see this picture placed in
a good position.” At her death I took it down to Trinity
where I was still an undergraduate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The portrait of queen Mary on the other side
of the dais is a Spanish copy of Antonio Moro’s
famous picture which hangs in Madrid. The
original is said to have been given to Philip after
his engagement to her; it presents her as a woman
of strong character but far from beautiful. When
the marriage took place, it was unkindly said by
a Spanish courtier that whatever were the faults of
his master, it must at least be admitted that he
recognized the obligation of a gentleman to keep
his word.</p>

<p>Of other pictures in the hall those of Tennyson
(1809–92) painted in 1890 by G. F. Watts, of the
earl of Essex (1566–1601) painted in 1590, of Isaac
Newton (1642–1727) painted in 1725 by John
Vanderbank, and of Francis Bacon (1561–1626)
copied from Van Somer’s portrait in Gray’s Inn are
<a name="png.117" id="png.117" href="#png.117"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>specially noticeable. Newton and Barrow (together
with Pearson who is mentioned below) played a
leading part in the intellectual life in the University
towards the close of the seventeenth century, but
I need not talk here about this. Barrow, who was
a mathematician and divine, had a ready wit. When,
previous to his admission to holy orders, he was
examined on his faith, the dialogue is said to have
been as follows:—Chaplain: <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Quid est fides?</i> Barrow:
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Quod non vides.</i> Chaplain: <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Quid est spes?</i> Barrow:
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Magna res.</i> Chaplain: <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Quid est caritas?</i> Barrow:
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Magna raritas.</i> On which his questioner retired in
dudgeon, and reported that there was a candidate
for ordination who would only give him “rhyming
answers to moral questions”: but the bishop had
the sense to recognize that truths can be expressed in
rhyme as well as in prose, and Barrow was ordained.</p>

<p>A very pleasing picture is that reputed to be
of Byron: this looks like a Raeburn, though it is
ascribed to Thomas Lawrence: its history is doubtful,
but the absence of any peculiarity in the ear is
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">prima facie</i> evidence that it is not of Byron. Another
striking portrait is that of W. H. Thompson (1810–1886)
painted in 1881 by Hubert von Herkomer.
When Thompson saw the completed portrait of
himself, he is said to have remarked, “Do I really
look as if I held the world so cheap” and in a print
of it in the house of one of my friends, this is inscribed
<a name="png.118" id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on the frame. I ought also to call attention to the
window portrait of Richard, duke of York (1411–60),
the father of Edward IV and Richard III, which
probably comes to us from King’s Hall.</p>

<p>Among other paintings, which at present hang
on the hall panelling, are portraits of the following
famous members of our College:—Edward White
Benson (1829–96) archbishop of Canterbury, Isaac
Hawkins Browne (1706–60), Arthur Cayley (1821–95),
the earl of Derby (1826–93), Michael Foster
(1836–1907), Francis Galton (1822–1911), the earl
of Halifax (1661–1715), Fenton John Anthony
Hort (1828–92), Richard Claverhouse Jebb (1841–1905),
Joseph Joachim (1831–1907) the musician,
Thomas Jones (1756–1807), Joseph Barber Lightfoot
(1828–89) bishop of Durham, Frederick Denison
Maurice (1805–72), James Clerk Maxwell (1831–79),
viscount Melbourne (1779–1849), Matthew Raine
(1760–1811), Adam Sedgwick (1785–1873), Henry
Sidgwick (1838–1900), Charles John Vaughan (1816–97),
Brooke Foss Westcott (1825–1901) bishop of
Durham, John Westlake (1828–1908), and William
Whewell (1794–1866).</p>

<p>Of these, Raine, Jones, Halifax and Hawkins
Browne lived in the eighteenth century. The last-named
is known to fame through having caused a
change in the family reigning in the two Sicilies.
In fact, coming to Naples in his travels he danced
<a name="png.119" id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at a court ceremony “with such inconceivable alacrity
and vigour” as to provoke universal amusement
and amazement: in particular the queen’s
laughter was so immoderate that a miscarriage ensued.
On such events may the histories of dynasties
and empires turn! He is described on this occasion
as pirouetting in a “dress of volcano silk
with lava buttons”: perhaps it is in this costume
that he is depicted on our walls. Having related
this anecdote I must in fairness add that he was
a poet of considerable ability, a good talker in an
age when the standard of conversation was high, and
an excellent judge of wine. Most of the portraits
are, however, of celebrities of the Victorian age.
Of these, Melbourne and Derby were politicians;
Benson, Hort, Lightfoot, Vaughan, and Westcott
represent the church; Westlake was a lawyer; Jebb
a scholar; Maurice and Sidgwick represent ethical
philosophy; while Cayley, Foster, Galton, Maxwell,
Sedgwick, and Whewell, were men of science.</p>

<p>Among the canvasses above the panelling are
portraits of Richard Bentley (1662–1742) the scholar,
Edward Coke (1549–1634) the lord chief justice,
Cowley (1618–67) the poet, John Dryden (1631–1701)
the poet, the earl of Macclesfield (1666–1732),
John Pearson (1613–86) bishop of Chester, Robert
Smith (1689–1768) the mathematician, and John
Wilkins (1614–72) bishop of Chester. Wilkins is
<a name="png.120" id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>now almost unknown but he wrote some interesting
books, notably one on the ciphers employed in the
civil war of the seventeenth century. Another work
of his on the possibility of a journey to the moon,
provoked the duchess of Newcastle to ask him where
she could find a place to bait if she tried the journey:
“Madam,” said he, “of all the people in the world
I least expected that question from you, who have
built so many castles in the air that you may lie
every night in one of your own.”</p>

<p>The pictures in the large combination room of
Isaac Newton by Thomas Murray, and of Matthew
Prior (1664–1721) by Godfrey Kneller are good:
the former came to us from a descendant (Mrs
Ring) of Newton’s favourite niece, and its history
is given in a letter from Charles Simeon to Mansel,
master of the College at the time of the gift. The
other canvasses are too big for a private apartment,
but the portraits of the “proud” duke of
Somerset (1662–1748) by Nathaniel Dance, the
marquess of Granby (1721–70) by Joshua Reynolds,
the duke of Gloucester by John Opie, the
marquess of Camden (1759–1840) by Thomas Lawrence,
the duke of Grafton (1760–1844) also by
Lawrence, and the duke of Sussex (1773–1843) by
James Lonsdale, are of some repute: to these there
was added in 1915 a portrait of Arthur J. Balfour
by P. A. Laszlö de Lombros.</p>

<p><a name="png.121" id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Of the peers mentioned above the names of
Granby and Somerset are still well known. Granby
fought in the Culloden campaign, was colonel of the
blues (horse guards) at Minden, 1759; commander of
the British contingent in the campaigns of 1760, 1761,
and 1762; and in 1766 became commander-in-chief
of the army. Delighting in danger, which even when
in supreme command he deliberately sought, brave
to a fault, an excellent cavalry leader, rich and
lavishly generous, he was the idol of the public,
and witnesses to his popularity remain in the
numerous public-houses scattered far and wide over
England which bear his name and arms. Somerset
was of a very different type, being a stupid man
whose power was chiefly derived from his enormous
landed possessions. To the Somerset properties he
added, by his marriage with the sole heiress of the
earls of Northumberland, the great estates of the
Percies. He held the chancellorship of the University
for the extraordinary term of sixty years.
His title of the “proud duke” commemorates only
his arrogance, and was derived from the fact that
even to speak to anyone in a menial position was
regarded by him as a condescension. His servants
were trained to understand his wishes by signs,
and numerous footmen surrounded him when in
the streets so as to avoid the risk that any people
of the lower classes should approach or address him.
<a name="png.122" id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Perhaps the best known of the stories of his pretensions
refers to his remark to his second wife
who once called his attention to something by
touching him with her fan (or according to another
version kissed him without asking his leave),
“Madam,” said he, drawing himself apart, “my
first wife never dared to take such a liberty, and
she was a Percy.” As another illustration of his
character I may add that he deprived one of his
daughters of <i>£</i>20,000 because she had sat down in
his presence without asking his leave.</p>

<p>In the lodge there are numerous portraits of
former masters of the College, and obviously this
is the proper place for such a collection. It is not
complete, twelve past masters being unrepresented,
but portraits of two of these (namely Wilkins and
Pearson) hang in the hall. The most notable
picture in this series is that of Nevile, which is properly
given the place of honour over the mantelpiece
in the dining room which he built. He holds
a paper in his right hand, and I like to think that
this is intended to suggest the letter which Elizabeth
on her death-bed entrusted to him to take to
Scotland, informing James VI of that kingdom that
she designated him as her successor. In this room
too are portraits of Porson and Thompson with
whose memories so many excellent academic stories
are associated, but I must not linger over these. In
<a name="png.123" id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the drawing room the most striking portraits are
those of queen Elizabeth by Mark Gerrard, the duke
of Gloucester (1776–1834) in his undergraduate
robes by George Romney, and queen Mary probably
by Hans Eworth. The painted panels in the
entrance hall often escape attention, but are worth
looking at, especially in the case of the portraits of
Edward III, Henry VII, Elizabeth of York, Mary
of Scotland, Edward VI, and queen Mary. The
collection of portraits, formed by Dr Butler, of
Trinity men who have held judicial appointments
is also interesting, but is not generally accessible
to visitors.</p>

<p>The pictures in the lecture-rooms and on the
walls of the staircase leading to them form a sort
of overflow collection, and though of unequal merit,
a few are worth attention. There are also some
pictures of merit in the library among which I note
in particular portraits of Tennyson and Lightfoot.</p>

<p>The engravings of former members of the College
placed in the small combination room will repay
study. There are at present between one hundred
and fifty and two hundred here, but there are many
more in portfolios in the library. Several of these
have been acquired in recent years through the
generosity and knowledge of John Charrington.</p>

<p>The painted glass in the hall shows numerous
coats of arms, and anyone acquainted with heraldry
<a name="png.124" id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will find here a rich field of study. The windows
could have been filled over and over again with the
arms of former famous members of the College, but
the matter has been managed in a haphazard way,
and many distinguished sons of the House are unrepresented.
In spite of some bad glass the collection
is interesting. Perhaps however any further
account of it here would be more technical than
would be justified in a paper like this. Of other
glass in the College, the windows in the chapel are
typical of the art of 1870, and are only moderately
satisfactory. The window at the south end of the
library, executed in 1775, was made by Peckitt
of York, after a design by Cipriani: it illustrates
some curious points in the history of the art of
stained glass, but the design is impossible, and the
scheme of colour atrocious.</p>

<p>Sculpture, unless it is absolutely first rate, does
not represent a man as well as portraiture. The
number of pieces of statuary of the first class in
Great Britain is small, and in the possession of such
pieces the College is extraordinarily fortunate. The
statue of Newton, with its proud inscription “Newton
qui genus humanum ingenio superavit,” in
the antechapel by Roubiliac—“the marble index
of a mind for ever voyaging through strange
seas of thought alone”—is of the highest merit.
It was described by Chantrey as “the noblest of
<a name="png.125" id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>English statues,” and I have never seen any
modern piece of statuary anywhere which can be
ranked superior to it: the man lives and almost
moves. Thorwaldsen’s statue of Byron, rejected
by the authorities of Westminster Abbey on account
of his alleged atheistical opinions, which stands in
the library, and that of Bacon in the antechapel
may also be reckoned among examples of first-class
statuary. Of these three pieces two are by foreigners.
There are also in the antechapel statues
of Barrow, Macaulay, Whewell, and Tennyson, and
in the library a large number of busts. The statues
of Edward III on the clock tower, of Henry VIII,
James I, Anne of Denmark, and Prince Charles on
the great gate, and of queen Elizabeth on the
queen’s gate are interesting, though not to be
reckoned as works of art.</p>

<p>Old Silver Plate has a peculiar beauty. We
have some fine specimens though they are fewer
and later than from our history we should expect.
Most of the pieces are kept in the butteries, and
can be seen by visitors. Twice a year anyone
entering the hall will see the junior bursar there
with all the plate spread before him checking it by
his lists, a pretty spectacle which always suggests
to me the picture of the king “in his counting house
counting out his money,” and formerly in “May-week”
typical pieces were set out on show in the hall.</p>

<p><a name="png.126" id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>We have a catalogue of the plate—a large and
valuable collection—owned by King’s Hall in the
fifteenth century, and we may reasonably suppose
that this, as well as the plate belonging to Michael-House,
came in due course to us; all this has gone
with the possible, but doubtful, exception of a
censer boat now in the library. We know also that
some plate was given us in Tudor and early Stuart
times: of this, only five pieces remained to us at
the restoration. I take it however that until well
into the eighteenth century people were accustomed
to regard plate, other than pieces of historic
interest, as a convenient way of keeping portable
wealth in a form which could be easily turned into
coin, and its dispersion in times of emergency when
money was wanted is not surprising.</p>

<p>It was customary for noblemen and fellow-commoners
to present plate to the House when they
completed their academic career: their caution-money
being commonly employed for or towards
the purpose. After the restoration, thanks to this
graceful practice, our possessions of this kind grew
rapidly. Unfortunately a good many of our pieces
were lost through two burglaries, one in 1795 and
the other in 1798; for instance, no less than fifty-five
drinking cups some of great beauty were then
taken. During the eighteenth century, in colleges
and throughout the country, large numbers of
<a name="png.127" id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“standing pieces” of plate were melted down, and
the metal used to make spoons and forks; this
accounts for the disappearance of some of our
treasures of an earlier date. Until 1870 new
pieces continued to be added in large numbers: in
that year the College abolished the general admission
of noblemen and fellow-commoners, holding
that distinctions of rank were undesirable in academic
life; and since then our collection has
increased only by special gifts or by purchase.</p>

<p>Of our pre-commonwealth plate the oldest pieces
are two silver-gilt flagons, dated 1607–08, given us
in 1636 by John and Bernard Stuart, sons of the
duke of Lennox, then about sixteen and fourteen
years old. There is in the small combination room
a charming print of Vandyke’s portrait of the
brothers: both boys were killed during the Civil
War, John at Edgehill and Bernard at Rowton
Heath. Whistles are placed in the handles of these
flagons, so they must have been originally intended
for secular use, but they have been included, as far
back as our records go, among the communion plate:
perhaps the spouts were added when the vessels
were placed in the chapel. Our next earliest piece
is the handsome cup, dated 1615–16, given us by
Nevile probably in 1615: it was originally silver-gilt.
The fourth of these pieces is a bursarial rose-water
basin and ewer dated 1635–36. We owe it to Ambrose
<a name="png.128" id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Aykerod who was bursar in that year: his arms are
engraved on the cup, and the inscriptions on it
refer to vows and pledges by him which are now
inexplicable. The only other early piece which survived
the Civil War was a cup given by John Clarkson
between 1610 and 1620 and known from its
inscription “Pauper Johannes Dictus Cognomine
Clarkson Hunc Cyathum Dono Gratuito Dedit”
as the “Pauper Joan Pot”: this was stolen in 1798.
Clarkson had matriculated as a sizar in 1553, obtained
a scholarship in due course, and graduated
B.A. in 1560.</p>

<p>Apart from the four pieces mentioned above, the
most striking objects in our collection are the rose-water
basins and ewers, the Duport standing salt,
the standing or loving cups, the tankards, and the
punch-bowls.</p>

<p>We have several notable rose-water basins and
ewers. The earliest of these is the set given by the
earl of Kent in 1662 to commemorate the passing of
the Act of Uniformity. The date is given by a
quaint double chronogram: and the central inscription
<span title="[Greek: Nipson anomêmata mê monan opsin]"
 xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Νιψον ανομηματα μη μοναν οψιν</span> reads alike
forwards and backwards. Another beautiful set is
that given by the duke of Buckingham in 1671, the
circumference of the basin being over seven feet.
The visitor should also notice a set of 1740 bequeathed by
David Humphrey, and a set of 1748
<a name="png.129" id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>given by William John Bankes. Another set consists
of a basin of 1716 given by John Bennet, with
a graceful ewer probably made about 1675. This
ewer must have been originally a “standing cup”
since a whistle is placed in the handle, but a spout
was added between 1789 and 1810 with the intention
of turning it into a flagon: on it are engraved
the Trinity and Westminster arms, and in an early
catalogue it is called the Busby cup: its donor is
unknown.</p>

<p>There is a curious custom at the high table connected
with these dishes. At the end of dinner on
ordinary nights, before grace is said, a rose-water
dish with an empty ewer is placed before the fellow
sitting at the head of each table. I conjecture that
this dates from a time when napkins and forks were
unknown, and diners were accustomed to rinse their
hands in water before rising from the table. Now
the appearance of the empty ewer is only a sign
that dinner is over. At feasts the ewer contains
rose-water which is poured into the dish and passed
round the table.</p>

<p>We have a fine specimen of a standing salt in
a piece associated with the name of James Duport.
Its breadth is nearly ten inches, and its height,
without the handles, seven inches. It was these
massive salts, and not “trencher salts,” that were
originally used to divide the company into those
<a name="png.130" id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that sat above and below the salt; and in the middle
ages the standing salt was generally the most valued
single piece in the house and the chief ornament on
the table. The medieval specimens usually have
a cover to protect the salt, and the handles in specimens
like ours are said to have been introduced for
a similar reason, as a napkin can be twisted round
them so as to cover the salt, and thus save it from
dust. Our specimen bears the inscription
<span title="[Greek: echete en eautois halas kai eirêneuete en allêlois]"
 xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">εχετε εν εαυτοις ἁλας και ειρηνευετε εν αλληλοις</span>, together
with a statement that it was given by Duport.
Probably his gift was made in 1665, when he left
the College on his appointment as master of
Magdalene. The piece, however, bears the hall-mark
1733–34; here, and in some other cases, it would
seem that the original piece was exchanged for a
new one, perhaps when repairs were required,
and it was the custom in such circumstances to
engrave the old inscription on the new piece of
plate.</p>

<p>In spite of our losses at the end of the eighteenth
century some fine drinking cups and covers still
remain in our possession. Notable among these is
one of 1691–92 given by Charles and George Firebrace,
one of 1697–98 given by Henry Boyle, and one
of 1711–12 given by John Verney. We have also
a cup and cover of 1726 given by the earl of Sandwich,
another of 1729 given by Samuel Husbands,
<a name="png.131" id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>another of 1763 given by John Damer, another of
1771 given by George Augustus Henry Cavendish,
another of 1776 given by William Greaves, and
another of 1780 given by the earl of Mexborough.
To these I may add the Lyndhurst silver-gilt cup
and cover of 1876–77 given by Sir Theodore Martin.
All these are fine specimens of silversmith’s work,
and can be used at feasts as loving cups, with the
ceremonial customary to such drinking.</p>

<p>The tankards with lids form another striking
group of plate, but the larger ones which contain
three quarts or more must be regarded as being
decorative rather than useful. Conspicuous among
these pieces is one, probably made about 1670, given
by Thomas Taylor, one of 1698–99 given by Peter
Pheasaunt, one of 1699–1700 given by Thomas
Alston, one of 1700–01 given by Thomas Bellot,
one of 1739–40 given by Thomas Foley, one of
1746–47 given by Francis Vernon, one of 1751–52
given by Charles Paulet, one of 1757–58 given by
Edward Fitzgerald, and one of 1762–63 given by
Hans Sloane. There is also a fine collection of ale
plate. Of the smaller tankards, stoups, and drinking
cups there are innumerable specimens. I will
not dwell longer over our other pieces. Suffice it
is to say that of punch-bowls there are three or four
fine specimens of the eighteenth century, as also
various snuff-boxes, silver trays, etc. Of candlesticks
<a name="png.132" id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there are between two and three hundred,
many of them beautiful pieces of work. Of ordinary
domestic plate the stock is large.</p>

<p>There is also a good deal of plate which has been
given or assigned for use in the lodge: this includes
the Perry silver-gilt dessert service. In the chapel
plate besides the flagons already mentioned there
are two silver-gilt patens of 1661–62, associated in
the early catalogues with the names of John and
Bernard Stuart; also an alms-dish of 1673, and an
altar cross given in 1894 and said to be of Spanish
renaissance work.</p>

<p>I add some particulars of thirteen challenge
pieces of plate owned by the Boat and Athletic
Clubs: of these, five belong to the First Trinity
Boat Club, and eight to the Athletic Club. These
pieces are of recent make and their chief interest
comes from the inscribed names of the successive
holders.</p>

<p>Trinity men will recollect that there are various
races arranged each year by the First Trinity Boat
Club, the winners of which receive pots or other
prizes, and that in five of these events, the winners,
in addition to receiving the special prizes, hold challenge
pieces on which are engraved the names of
past winners. These challenge pieces are: A two-handled
silver chased cup and stand (hall-mark
1836), held by the winner of a sculling race (the
<a name="png.133" id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Macnaughten Sculls) rowed in the Michaelmas Term,
open to all members of the Club who have not
previously won it or the University Colquhoun
Sculls. A two-handled silver cup and stand (hall-mark
probably 1857 or 1858), which came to the
club from the now defunct Second Trinity Boat
Club, held by the winner of a sculling race (the
Baines Sculls) rowed in the Lent Term, open to
all members who have not previously won it or
the Macnaughten Sculls or the University Colquhoun
Sculls. Silver oars (hall-mark 1860) held by the
winners of a pair-oared race (the Wyatt Pairs)
rowed in the Michaelmas Term, open to all members
who have not previously won it or the University
Magdalene Pairs. Silver oars (hall-mark 1861)
which came to the Club from Second Trinity, held
by the winners of a pair-oared race (the Dodington
Pairs) rowed in the Lent Term, open to all members
who have not previously won it or the Wyatt Pairs
or the University Magdalene Pairs. Silver Sculls
(hall-mark 1897) held by the winners of a double
sculling race (the Taxis Sculls) rowed in the Easter
Term, open to all members who have not previously
won it or the University Magdalene pairs.</p>

<p>Similarly among the sports arranged each year
by the Trinity Athletic Club are seven events, the
winners of which in addition to receiving special
prizes, hold challenge pieces of plate on which are
<a name="png.134" id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>engraved the names of past winners. These challenge
pieces are: A half-fluted silver bowl and plinth
(hall-mark 1887) held by the winner of the mile
race. A half-fluted silver bowl and plinth (hall-mark
1899) held by the winner of the half-mile
race. A silver chased claret jug with handle (hall-mark
1886) held by the winner of the quarter-mile
race. Four silver candlesticks (hall-mark 1899) held
by the winner of the hundred yards race. A two-handled
half-fluted silver cup (hall-mark 1888) held
by the winner of the hurdles race. A two-handled
silver bowl (hall-mark 1896) held by the winner of
the long jump. A silver salver (hall-mark 1896)
held by the winner of the high jump. Finally there
is a two-handled silver chased cup and plinth (hall-mark
1892) held by the man who scores most marks
in the various events.</p>

<p>It may be thought that I have occupied too
much space in giving bare lists of pieces of plate,
but the shapes of some of the pieces are so good and
the surface of old silver, when carefully tended,
has such a beautiful texture that I believe it may
be worth calling the attention of any interested in
such things to some of our possessions of this kind.
Only societies and families with continuous records
dating from a distant past can show such collections.</p>

 /><small>THE COLLEGE AUDITORS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">There</span> is no reference in our earliest college
statutes—those of 1552—to an Auditor, but
the extant accounts show that the office existed from
the foundation of the College in 1546. Definite regulations
for the appointment were proposed in the
draft statutes of 1554, and were embodied in the
statutes of 1560. By these the auditor was made
one of the statutable officers of the Society: the
post was held for long periods, and it was not permissible
to perform the duties by proxy. The
statute in question was re-enacted in 1844. By the
statutes of 1861 the office was made annual, and
tenable only during pleasure. It remains annual
under the present statutes, but a definite proviso
was inserted in 1882 that it is not tenable by a
fellow or officer of the House, and a clause was
introduced providing for the appointment from
among the fellows of an Assessor or Assessors who
should be present during the audit.</p>

<p>From the foundation of the College, its financial
year ran from Michaelmas to Michaelmas, and the
audit of each year was concluded in the following
December. At first the annual honorarium of the
<a name="png.136" id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>auditor seems to have been <i>£</i>10 with an allowance
of <i>£</i>2 for travelling expenses, stationery, etc., but
before the end of the sixteenth century it had been
reduced to <i>£</i>5, with an augmentation of <i>£</i>3. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
and some allowances.</p>

<p>The form of the <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">declaratio computi</i> was much as
at present, and generally, with but small variations,
it takes the form now stereotyped “and so the said
A. B. Senior (or Junior) Bursar upon the foot of
this his account for one whole year ending Michaelmas
... oweth unto the College the sum <span class="nw">of....”</span>
In some cases, and notably in the seventeenth
century, the sums include fractions of a penny,
even as small as one thirty-second part thereof.
Presumably the audit was always followed by a
“feast,” as still remains the custom.</p>

<p>Of the occupants of the office from 1546 to 1618
the information in the college books is incomplete.
The only auditors previous to 1618 whose names
I have noticed, with the years in which they held
office, are Edward Burnell, 1553, 1561, 1563 and
1564; Adam Winthrop, 1606; and Richard Brooke,
1614. I have not, however, read the account-books
through from cover to cover, and it may be
that there are references which have escaped me.
Luckily Winthrop’s diary and some memoranda from
1595 to 1621 are extant, and contain references to
a few earlier dates. From these we can take our
<a name="png.137" id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>continuous record back to the year ending Michaelmas
1593, when he was auditor. He resigned in 1610,
and was succeeded by Brooke. Brooke was acting
in 1615, and had commons in 1616, and I have no
doubt acted in 1617. From 1618 onwards we can,
from one source or another, make out the names of
those who held the office. The handwritings of
the earlier auditors have marked characteristics.
They suggest that there was one auditor from 1547
to 1552, another from 1553 to 1578, who must have
been Edward Burnell, another from 1579 to 1591,
and another from 1592 to 1609, who must have been
Adam Winthrop. But I present these as mere
surmises, and I do not attempt to go back beyond
1593.</p>

<p>Our roll then is as follows. From 1547 to 1592
we cannot definitely say more than that Edward
Burnell was auditor for a period which included the
years 1553 to 1564, for no doubt his tenure was
unbroken. From 1593 the sequence runs thus:</p>

<p>Adam Winthrop, 1593 (or earlier) to 1609; Richard
Brooke, 1610 to 1617; Robert Spicer, 1618 to 1628;
Francis Hughes, 1629 to 1668; Samuel Newton,
1669 to 1717, Newton resigned in 1674, and thereon
he and William Ellis were appointed to the office,
with remainder to the survivor of them, but
apparently William Ellis never acted; Denys L’Isle,
1718 to 1726; William Greaves, 1727 to 1778; Robert
<a name="png.138" id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Graham, 1779 to 1791; Samuel Knight, 1792 to 1811;
Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, 1812 to 1825; James
Parke, 1826 to 1828; Andrew Amos, 1829 to 1836;
John George Shaw-Lefevre, 1837 to 1851; George
Denman, 1852 to 1862; George Valentine Yool, 1863
to 1869; Augustus Arthur VanSittart, 1870 to 1881;
John Willis Clark, 1882 to 1908. Since 1908 the
office has been held by a professional accountant.
The dates given indicate the ends of the audit year:
thus the audit of 1669 was for the year 1668–69. It
will be noticed that during the three hundred and
sixteen years from 1593 to 1908, there were, if we
omit William Ellis, only seventeen auditors, giving
an average tenure of more than eighteen years.
Of these seventeen auditors at least eleven have
been lawyers and four ultimately rose to the Bench.
I add a few biographical notes on these auditors.</p>

<p>Of Edward Burnell, the earliest holder of the
office whose name I have given, I know nothing.
His successor Adam Winthrop, 1548–1623, the son
of a prominent London merchant and reformer,
had been admitted as a fellow-commoner at Magdalene
in 1567, and had left the University without
a degree. He had been called to the bar, but did
not practise, and was content to fill the rôle of a
well-to-do country squire. He was an intimate
friend of Still, master of Trinity from 1577 to 1593,
whose sister he married in 1574, and whose wife
<a name="png.139" id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was his connection by marriage. I conjecture that
he owed the office to Still’s influence. Winthrop
was a fair scholar, an indifferent poet, and somewhat
of a pedant. His tomb is at Groton, Suffolk.
More than one of his descendants were distinguished.
In particular his son, John, 1588–1649, who was
admitted to Trinity College in 1602, was the founder
of the well-known American family of this name;
and his great-great-grandson, Sir George Downing
was the founder of Downing College.</p>

<p>Winthrop seems to have done the whole of the
audit work at the end of the Michaelmas term of
each year. Thus in 1601 he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ivth of Decemb. I ridde to Cambride &amp; beganne the
Auditt the 7th beinge Monday. The xiiijth of Decembre I
returned from the Auditt &amp; did see the Sonne in the Eclips
about 12 of the Clock at noone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Perhaps his resignation was made at the suggestion
of the College, for early in 1610 he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr Meriton came to speake with me about the resignation
of my office in Trinity College to Mr <span class="nw">Brookes....</span>
I surrendered my Auditorship in Trinitye College to the Mr
fellows &amp; schollers before a pub. <span class="nw">notary....</span> I dyned at Dr
Meriton’s in Hadley &amp; received of him xxlb for my <span class="nw">Auditorshippe....</span>
Mr Rich. Brooke the nue Auditor of Trinity
College was at my house in Groton to whom I dd. divers
paper books &amp; Roles touchinge his Office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the next three auditors I can discover very
little. Richard Brooke was appointed in 1610.
<a name="png.140" id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The following conclusion of 8 June 1615, seems to
refer to him, “concluded that Mr Brookes in regard
of his paines taken divers times for the Colledge
that he shoulde ... have given him Twentye
pounds,” and during his visits in the following
year be allowed commons. We may assume that
he held office till the end of 1617. A Richard
Brookes had entered at Queens’ as a fellow-commoner
in 1587, but whether he was the subsequent
auditor there is nothing to show. In 1618 we have
the copy of the appointment of Robert Spicer.
He held office till the end of 1628, since a conclusion
of 3 June 1629, appointed in his place Francis
Hughes. Hughes, who held the office till his death
in October 1669, was admitted a scholar in 1616,
graduated M.A. in 1623, was one of the esquire-bedells,
and occupied rooms in College at the time
of his death.</p>

<p>The next occupant of the office was Samuel
Newton, 1629–1718, a prominent attorney in the
town and mayor in 1671. He was not a member
of the University. His diary from 1662 to 1717
preserved in the library of Downing College, contains
an account of his election to the post in the
chapel by the master and seniors, he being present
in the antechapel. He attended next day in his
gown, was sworn to the faithful discharge of his
duties, and signed the roll of college officers. He
<a name="png.141" id="png.141" href="#png.141"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>proved thoroughly efficient. For his services at the
audit in 1669 he received the fee of <i>£</i>5 with the customary
augmentation of <i>£</i>3. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, a sum of <i>£</i>6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for engrossing the audit rolls, which henceforth
were kept excellently, a sum of <i>£</i>1 for preparing a
book of arrears, and a sum of <i>£</i>1. 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for stationery.
He also received from the junior bursar,
billets of wood of the value of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; from the
steward, a “warp of lyng” of the value of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>;
from the manciple, a “coller of brawne, also a dish
of wild fowle or 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”; and from the brewhouse,
“2 barrels of strong beere.”</p>

<p>In 1674 Newton surrendered his patent of appointment
as auditor, but he was immediately reappointed
jointly with his cousin, William Ellis,
with remainder to the survivor of them. They
were at the same time appointed on the same conditions
to the office of college registrar, then vacant
by the death of a Mr T. Griffith. According to
Newton’s diary, William Ellis proceeded M.A. in
1670, but his name does not appear in the list of
graduati, unless indeed he is the Wm Ellis who received
the degree <i>per lit. reg.</i> in 1671. The college
account-books continued to be signed by Newton,
and I have not noticed in them evidence that Ellis
ever took any part in the audit. The Society’s
solicitors and attorneys have frequently acted as
registrars, and it may be that Ellis was in partnership
<a name="png.142" id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with Newton, and was for that reason made
with him joint auditor and registrar.</p>

<p>Samuel Newton died in 1718 in his ninetieth
year. For the three years, 1715, 1716, and 1717,
the books were audited by John Newton, presumably
his son or grandson, as his deputy. No doubt
the arrangement was made in consequence of the
failing health of the old gentleman whose signature
in 1714 was very shaky. The appointment of a
deputy was invalid under the statute, but it must
have been made with the approval of Bentley, and
perhaps of the seniority. At any rate John Newton
conducted the audit, and signed the books as deputy
auditor.</p>

<p>Newton was succeeded in 1718 as auditor and
registrar by Denys L’Isle. L’Isle had been a fellow-commoner
of Trinity Hall, admitted in 1712, graduated
LL.B. in 1715, who had gone down and in
1716 taken his name off the books. He was a
vigorous and not too scrupulous barrister. He
owed his appointment to Bentley, and he showed
“extraordinary activity and zeal in promoting all”
his benefactor’s “wishes and interests” and represented
him in some of his disputes. Whatever view
may be taken of Bentley’s character, no one can
justify his conduct in regard to the college finances.
A notable scandal occurred in the audit of 1722. In
the accounts of that year large sums were charged
<a name="png.143" id="png.143" href="#png.143"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to the College for works at the lodge and other sums
spent by the master which had not been sanctioned
by the Society. Undoubtedly the charges were
illegal, but Bentley and L’Isle refused to allow the
accounts to be examined by the seniority. In fact
in this, as in other matters, L’Isle had no scruple in
screening Bentley from the consequences of acts
which were neither legal nor honourable.</p>

<p>L’Isle died in 1727, and was succeeded as auditor,
steward of the courts, and registrar by William
Greaves. Greaves had in 1719 migrated to Clare,
Cambridge, from Brasenose, Oxford; he graduated
B.A. in 1720, and in 1722 was elected at Clare to a
fellowship which he held till 1742. He was a barrister
and an able man: he too owed his office to
Bentley, and acted as his counsel in many of his
tortuous proceedings. Through Bentley’s influence
Greaves had in 1726 been made commissary of the
University, an office which he held till 1778. The
letters patent to the office of college auditor were
made out for the term of his life, but a question
having been raised as to whether this was statutable,
he surrendered them, and the College granted
new patents for the term of fifty years if he should
live so long. I suppose he was duly admitted to the
office, for probably an acute lawyer would have seen
to this, but there is no record of the fact in our books.</p>

<p>Greaves seems to have performed his duties as
<a name="png.144" id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>auditor in an honourable manner. After the audit
of 1778, he surrendered his office at the close of fifty
years’ tenure of it: he then received a present of plate
from the College, with their thanks for his long and
faithful services. Six years later he made a donation
to the Society of <i>£</i>100 to found an annual prize
for an essay on the character of King William the
Third. After nearly a century it was said that the
essayists had exhausted the subject, and in 1882
the College got leave to substitute for it one connected
with the history of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Robert Graham, 1744–1836, a lawyer of note,
succeeded Greaves. Graham had graduated as
third wrangler in 1766, and in the following year
had been elected to a fellowship. He held the
office till after the audit of 1791. He was made
a baron of the exchequer in 1799, and proved a
singularly inefficient judge. He retired from the
bench in 1827.</p>

<p>Graham’s chief distinction is said to have been
his urbanity, and at the Bar it was currently believed
that no one but his sempstress had power to
ruffle his equanimity. He was somewhat pompous,
and an adventure of his at the assizes at Newcastle
afforded much amusement to his contemporaries.
There, on one occasion just before charging the
grand jury, he tumbled, unnoticed, into the river
from the garden of the house where he lodged, but
<a name="png.145" id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>luckily was hauled out by some passing watermen.
The rough remedies of the quay-side failed to restore
consciousness, and the bystanders, supposing
he was drowned, carted him to a dead-house, where
he was stripped and laid out. The coroner’s jury,
summoned with unusual celerity, had viewed the
body, and were considering their verdict when, to
their surprise he showed signs of life and came to
himself. His position was not altogether dignified,
but realizing at once that it is always incumbent on
a judge to move in state, he was by his directions
fetched from the mortuary in the sheriff’s carriage,
with the trumpeters, and usual ceremonial.</p>

<p>Of Graham’s successor, Samuel Knight, 1755–1829,
I know little. He had been admitted as a
pensioner in 1772, became a fellow-commoner in
1774, and graduated in the poll in 1776. Apparently
he had no special qualifications for the post
beyond being a pleasant member of society. He
resigned in 1812, and died in 1829.</p>

<p>After Knight’s resignation, the post was offered
to Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, 1776–1846, a lawyer
of distinction. He had graduated in 1799 as eighth
wrangler, was a Chancellor’s medalist, and had been
elected to a fellowship in 1801, which, as he did not
take orders, he had vacated in due course in accordance
with the provisions of the Elizabethan statutes.
The plan of offering the post to a distinguished
<a name="png.146" id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>past fellow now became the custom, and all the
auditors hereafter mentioned were past fellows of
the college.</p>

<p>Tindal was one of the counsel for queen Caroline;
he is celebrated in the history of the courts for
having secured to a criminal client the right of
wager of battle, which had long fallen into disuse
but had not been abolished by statute. He was
member for the University from 1827 to 1829 in
which year he was made chief justice of the Common
Pleas; he held that office till his death in 1846.
Though not specially successful as an advocate, he
had a profound knowledge of law and was an excellent
judge. His enormous dimensions are commemorated
in a print in my possession with the
inscription “Judges of A Size,” representing him
standing by Joshua Williams one of his colleagues
on assize, who was very diminutive; probably this
is an ancient joke.</p>

<p>The next auditor was James Parke, 1782–1868,
a lawyer of even greater distinction. He had
graduated in 1803 as fifth wrangler, and had been
Craven scholar, Browne’s medalist and Chancellor’s
medalist. In 1804 he had been elected to a fellowship.
He was one of the counsel briefed against
queen Caroline. He was made a judge in 1828,
and of course then resigned the office of auditor,
which he thus held for only three years.</p>

<p><a name="png.147" id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Parke had a profound knowledge of the common
law, and admired, and was a rigid adherent of,
ancient forms and customs. The fact was well
known, and led to a curious scene, when on one occasion,
while giving a judgment, he fainted. Cold
water and smelling salts were applied without
success, whereon a somewhat malicious colleague
brought from an adjacent room an ancient volume
of reports, black with the dust of ages, and banged
it under the nostrils of the judge. It may have
been a coincidence, but Parke at once revived, and
in a few minutes was able to proceed with the
business in hand.</p>

<p>At one time when Parke was trying a criminal
case the prisoner confessed his crime to his advocate,
who thereupon (most improperly) acquainted the
judge with the fact and asked his advice. Parke
rebuked the barrister for informing him of the
prisoner’s guilt, but added that counsel was not the
less bound to defend his client to the best of his
ability. The case has been often cited, and states
the practice of the bar; it being of course assumed
that nothing is said or done for the defence which
an honourable man might not say or do.</p>

<p>Parke’s subsequent career served to settle a
constitutional question of great importance. In
1856 he was created Baron Wensleydale with a life
peerage. It was decided that the power of the
<a name="png.148" id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>crown to create life peerages had been lost by disuse.
He was then made a baron with the usual remainder
in tail male.</p>

<p>Parke was followed as auditor by Andrew Amos,
1791–1860, also a lawyer of distinction. He had
graduated as fifth wrangler in 1813, and in 1815
had been elected to a fellowship. He was appointed
auditor in 1829. He had a large arbitration practice,
acted on the Criminal Law Commission, and
was professor of English Law in London. In 1837
he was appointed legal member of the Indian
Council, and on his departure for the East had to
resign his office in the college. On the first vacancy
after his return to England, he was, in 1848, elected
Downing Professor of Laws in Cambridge, and
occupied the chair until his death.</p>

<p>Amos was succeeded by John George Shaw-Lefevre,
1797–1879. Shaw-Lefevre had been senior
wrangler and first Smith’s prize man in 1818, and had
been elected to a fellowship in the following year.
Like his predecessors he was a barrister, but most
of his time was taken up with duties connected with
public departments. He settled the county divisions
under the Reform Act of 1832, and was a
member of numerous Commissions, notably those
connected with compensation for the abolition of
slavery, with the Poor Law Act, with the creation of
South Australia, with ecclesiastical affairs, and with
<a name="png.149" id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the Indian Civil Service: till 1875 he was busily
engaged in public affairs. He stood unsuccessfully
for parliament in the university contest of 1847.
He resigned the auditorship after the audit of 1851.
His tenure of the post is commemorated by his gift
of the chandelier which hangs in the large combination
room.</p>

<p>The next auditor was the Hon. George Denman,
1819–1896, also a lawyer. Denman had been
senior classic in 1842, and had been elected to a
fellowship in the following year. He had always
kept up his connection with the College, where
he had numerous friends. He became auditor in
1852. Like his predecessor he stood unsuccessfully
for parliament as a representative of the University:
this was in 1856. Subsequently he was
appointed counsel to the University. He entered
parliament in 1859, and owing to press of work gave
up his college office at the close of the audit of 1862.
After a distinguished legal career he was raised in
1872 to the bench. He was a good scholar, had a
fine presence, and to the end of his life was popular
with all classes of Cambridge society.</p>

<p>If I may trust my memory Denman told me that
among his annual perquisites as auditor was a case
of audit ale, and that on one occasion he gave it to
Livingstone who he knew would appreciate it. The
case travelled with the explorer through Africa,
<a name="png.150" id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and as long as the ale lasted glasses of it were circulated,
to the great satisfaction of the natives,
whenever solemn treaties were ratified.</p>

<p>The next holder of the office was George Valentine
Yool, 1829–1897, a chancery barrister, who had
been third wrangler and second Smith’s prizeman
in 1851, and had been elected to a fellowship in 1853.
Yool took but little part in public affairs. He was
appointed auditor in 1863, and gave up the office
at the end of 1869.</p>

<p>After Yool’s resignation the College reverted to
its former practice, and appointed as auditor a
resident, Augustus Arthur VanSittart. VanSittart
had been bracketed senior classic in 1847, and had
been elected to a fellowship in the following year.
After once standing unsuccessfully for parliament,
he devoted himself to literary work, and among
other things collected and collated the various
readings of the New Testament. His annual speech
at the audit feast, wherein he gave a witty sketch
of the more interesting developments of academic
life during the preceding year, was one of the
features of the time, and served somewhat the same
purpose as the Tripos verses of earlier ages. He
held the office till his death in the spring of 1882.
He was wealthy, and a most generous benefactor
of the Fitzwilliam Museum and other Cambridge
institutions.</p>

<p><a name="png.151" id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>On VanSittart’s death the post was given to
John Willis Clark, 1833–1910. Clark had come up
to Trinity in 1852, obtained a first class in the
classical tripos, 1856, and was elected to a fellowship
in 1858. He made his home in Cambridge, and his
unceasing activities in zoological, library, and theatrical
matters are chronicled in the local records.
He completed the <cite>Architectural History of the
University</cite>—a permanent and invaluable record of
Cambridge history—which had been commenced by
his uncle, and wrote on various library and antiquarian
subjects. He held the registraryship of
the University from 1891 to his death in 1910.</p>

<p>Clark vacated the office of auditor in 1908, and
since then the College has appointed to the post a
professional accountant.</p>

 /><small>WREN’S DESIGNS FOR THE COLLEGE LIBRARY.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">In</span> 1914 the College obtained an interesting series
of photographs of Wren’s original drawings and
plans for our library in Nevile’s Court. They will
well repay inspection by those who are interested
in our history or in architecture.</p>

<p>The present library is the third building assigned
by Trinity for the purpose. During the first half-century
of its existence the Society used the library<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn26" id="fna26" name="fna26">26</a></sup>
of King’s Hall, a good first-floor room, some twenty
feet long by ten feet broad, which had been built
in 1416–21 near the north-west corner of the cloister
court of that House. This room was connected with
the old oratory of King’s Hall by a gallery over the
west cloister.</p>

<p>Soon after the foundation of Trinity the provision
of a larger library was contemplated, and in
the order (about providing building materials for
the chapel) of queen Elizabeth of 1560, it is said
that its erection had been already begun. In fact
however it was then only under discussion.</p>

<div class="chap"><!-- note not actually a new chapter -->
<p>Our predecessors, in their arrangements for the
“reconcination” or rebuilding of the Great Court,
<a name="png.157" id="png.157" href="#png.157"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>naturally attached great importance to not interfering
with King Edward’s Tower which had long
been the chief entrance to King’s Hall and then
stood near the present sundial. A suggested way
of working this Tower into the scheme of the court
is shown on the plan which hangs on the staircase
leading to the library annexe; in this, a block one
hundred feet long and thirty-four feet broad, was
to be built over an open colonnade running eastwards
from the Tower and ending in front of and
a few yards from the Great Gate. The first floor of
this block might have been used for the new library;
or alternatively it might have been used for chambers,
and the new library built elsewhere, for instance, as
was suggested, on the site of the range of chambers
which now stretches from the chapel to the turret
staircase adjoining the lodge.</p>

<p>Neither of these proposals was then adopted,
and our second library was not erected till Nevile,
between 1594 and 1600, took the matter in hand.
He provided for it a room seventy-five feet long and
thirty feet broad on the second floor of the range
connecting the Clock Tower and the lodge; it has
since been converted into chambers.</p>

<p>Less than a century after Nevile’s library was
finished, the Society again found it necessary to
provide more book accommodation, and the result
is the impressive and excellently designed building
<a name="png.158" id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which stands on the west side of Nevile’s Court.
According to tradition, its erection, commenced in
February 1676, was due to Barrow, then master of
the College, who in the previous year had pressed
the other heads of Houses to provide a room worthy
of the University for its meetings, and urged that
it should be of the best. Such schemes are expensive
and cannot be effected without public
spirit. Caution, it is said, carried the day, whereon
Barrow, piqued at this faint-heartedness, declared
that he would go to Trinity, “lay out the foundations
of a building to enlarge his back court, and
close it with a stately library, which should be
more magnificent and costly than what he had
<span class="nw">proposed....</span> And he was as good as his word, for
that very afternoon he ... staked out the very
foundation upon which the building now stands.”</p>

<p>The story may be substantially true, for the long-cherished
idea of building a university theatre and
library was then in the hands of a syndicate: on the
other hand the extant speech of Barrow in which he
put forward his policy was not delivered till the
Easter term 1676, and Wren’s designs for such a
building are referred to the year 1678 and indicate
that the scheme had not been then abandoned. But
whether the anecdote be true or not, we may take
it that the erection of our library was due to
Barrow’s initiative, and that he personally raised
a considerable sum towards its cost.</p>

<p><a name="png.159" id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>151<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Sir Christopher Wren, a warm personal friend
of Barrow, was selected as the architect, and placed
his services at the disposal of the College without
remuneration. His original drawings are included
in a collection of his designs preserved at All Souls’
College, Oxford, and by the kindness of that Society
we have been allowed to take photographs of the
plans which concern us. These relate to two plans for
our library and one for a university commencement-house.
The two plans for Trinity were made not later
than 1675; they may have been submitted as alternatives,
but there is a tradition that the second design
was prepared only after the first had been rejected.</p>

<p>Nevile’s Court, as now arranged, contains three
staircases on each of its sides, is closed on the east
by the hall and small combination room block, and
on the west by the library. In 1675 only two of
the staircases on each side had been built, and the
western ends of these were connected by a blank
wall pierced in the middle by a gate, which is believed
to have been later removed, stone by stone,
and finally placed as the entrance to the College at
the bottom of Trinity lane, where it now stands.
Beyond this wall and between it and the river was the
college tennis court. The land between Nevile’s Court
and the river was selected as the site of the library.</p>

<p>Wren’s first design shows a double cylindrical
shell about sixty-five feet across inside and ninety
<a name="png.160" id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>152<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>feet high, surmounted by a dome and entered
through a six-columned Ionic portico facing Nevile’s
Court. On the ground floor was a lobby round
which were stone seats. Above this the inside of
the inner cylindrical shell was lined with bookshelves,
and for convenience of approach there were
three galleries. The room was lighted by windows
in the dome and a superimposed lantern. The
east side of the portico was half-way between the
western ends of the court, and these ends were connected
with the body of the library by low curved
walls surmounted by iron rails. This building is
described as “a very beautiful and most commodious
model,” but it strikes the ordinary layman as poor
in design, and I do not think that all Wren’s genius
could have made it other than unsatisfactory. Why
it was rejected we do not know, but few will doubt
that the decision was wise.</p>

<p>Wren’s second or alternative design, which was
adopted, shows a lofty oblong room about one
hundred and fifty feet long by thirty-eight feet
broad supported on a colonnade. Several of his
drawings for this were engraved for the <cite>Architectural
History of Cambridge</cite> by Willis and Clark, but the
photographic reproductions of the originals—some
with Wren’s notes attached—which are now available
have an interest of their own. A careful study
will show details which were subsequently modified.
The present library was placed to the west of the
<a name="png.161" id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>153<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>court as then built, and the rows of chambers on each
side were extended to meet it. It is well-known that
the shelves, cases, benches, tables, and book-rests
now used were designed by Wren, and his drawings
for them are reproduced in this series of photographs.
The removal of all the bookcases except those fixed
against the walls would enable us to judge the appearance
intended by Wren. How fine the effect
must have been, may be gathered from the plate
in Le Keux’s <cite>Memorials</cite> or the engraving in the
<cite>University Almanack</cite> of 1852.</p>

<p>Among Wren’s plans is also one for “a Theatre
or Commencement-House with a Library annexed,
according to an Intention for the University of
Cambridge, about the year 1678, but not executed.”
Whether this represents a sketch of the general
plan which it is said that Barrow had suggested to
the heads of Houses in 1675 it is impossible to say.
The erection of a building on these lines might have
been costly, but the result would have been a
valuable addition to the architecture of Cambridge.</p>

<p>I published in the <cite>Trinity Magazine</cite> in 1914 the
elevations of our library according to Wren’s two
plans and of his suggested Commencement or Senate
House. I reprint these here (see above, pp. 145–148),
but add nothing more as it is intended shortly to
reproduce in book-form various drawings on the
subject made by Wren.</p>

 /><small>A CHRISTMAS JOURNEY IN 1319.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">In</span> the Record Office in London are preserved some
money accounts<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn27" id="fna27" name="fna27">27</a></sup> concerned with a visit of the
scholars of King’s Hall to York at Christmas in the
year 13 Edward II, that is, in 1319. The following
analysis gives the route followed by one section of
the party and the expenses of the journey: it is a
valuable record of the method and cost of travelling
in medieval times.</p>

<p>By way of preamble, I may say that the origin
of King’s Hall is to be found in the establishment at
Cambridge, in 1317, by Edward II, of a body of
Scholars or King’s Children; that they were regarded
as part of the royal household; and that the
nominations to the office of warden and to scholarships
were reserved to the king. King’s Hall was
dissolved in 1546, and its buildings and property
assigned by Henry VIII to Trinity College.</p>

<p>Early in December 1319, the warden and scholars
were ordered to spend the coming Christmas with
the court, then at York, and the sheriff of Cambridgeshire
was directed to provide for their journey.
During the preceding Michaelmas term thirty-three
<a name="png.163" id="png.163" href="#png.163"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>members of the House had been in residence, and
all of them went to York.</p>

<p>The names of the members of the House in 1319
are immaterial to our story, but I venture to give
them, for these students lived here nearly six centuries
ago, and doubtless had hopes, plans, and ambitions
at bottom much the same as we have. They
were, in order of seniority, John de Bagshot the
warden, Nicholas de Durnford, Nicholas de Rome,
David de Winchester, William Pour, Richard Pour,
Nicholas Pour, John de Aston, John de Torterold,
James de Torterold, Robert de Immeworth, Thomas
de Windsor, Walter de Nottingham, Roger Parker,
John de Kelsey, John de Hull, Edward de Kingston,
Hugh de Sutton, Philip de London, John de Salisbury,
Richard de Salisbury, Robert de Beverley,
John Fort, Ralph de Gretford, Henry de Gretford,
Nicholas Parker, Nicholas Pull, Richard de Berwick,
Andrew Rosekin, Thomas Griffon, John Griffon,
William Draghswerd, and John de Woodstock. It
will be noticed that some of the students are designated
by surnames which were already coming into
use and some by place names: the latter show from
what a wide area the scholars were drawn.</p>

<p>For the purpose of travelling the Society was
divided into two sections, both of which started
from Cambridge on Thursday<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn28" id="fna28" name="fna28">28</a></sup>, 20 December. One
<a name="png.164" id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>party, comprising the warden, John de Bagshot,
and six of the scholars, went on horseback, and
arrived at York on Christmas eve. Their journey thus
occupied five days and they covered about thirty-five
miles a day; of it we have no particulars, save
that the warden paid <i>£</i>1. 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the hire in
Cambridge of seven hackneys, and was allowed
<i>£</i>1. 9<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for the other expenses, namely 10<i>d.</i> a day
for each member of the party. The remaining
twenty-six scholars travelled under the care of one
of their number, John de Aston, and arrived at York
on 28 December. They took with them seven and
a half lengths of cloth with the furs thereto belonging,
and four grooms, but whether the grooms went
the whole way is not clear. It is with this nine
days’ journey that I here deal.</p>

<p>The cloth and furs which had been purchased
on behalf of the crown from merchants at Bury were
valuable. The former was red in colour (<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">de blodes
mixto</i>) and had cost <i>£</i>21. 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>: the latter comprised
twenty-one lamb skins, bought for <i>£</i>2. 19<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
and six budge skins, bought for <i>£</i>1. The carriage
of these goods must have been a serious hindrance
to rapid travelling.</p>

<p>The first two days, Thursday and Friday, 20 and
21 December, were occupied in the journey from
Cambridge to Spalding. This was made in two
hired boats (with the services of six men), for which
<a name="png.165" id="png.165" href="#png.165"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>157<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the charge was 5<i>s.</i> On 20 December, the travellers
paid 2<i>d.</i> for porterage of their goods to the boats at
Cambridge, 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for bread, 2<i>s.</i> for beer, 1<i>s.</i> for
herrings, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for hard fish and codlings, and 4<i>d.</i>
for fuel. On 21 December they paid 1<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> for
bread, 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for beer, 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for herrings and other
fish, 3<i>d.</i> for cheese, 2<i>d.</i> for porterage from the boats
at Spalding, 5½<i>d.</i> for fuel and candles, and 8<i>d.</i> for
beds at Spalding.</p>

<p>On Saturday, 22 December, they travelled to
Boston. On this day, they paid 2<i>s.</i> for hiring two
carts for carrying the cloth and fourteen of the
scholars, and 3<i>s.</i> for twelve hackneys for the rest of
the party. They also spent 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for bread,
1<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> for beer, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for herrings and other fish,
5<i>d.</i> for fuel and candles, and 8<i>d.</i> for beds at Boston.</p>

<p>The next two days, Sunday and Monday, 23 and
24 December, were occupied in the journey to Lincoln
which was performed in a single large boat. On
23 December, they paid 5<i>s.</i> for the hire of this boat,
4<i>d.</i> for straw to spread on it, 2<i>d.</i> for porterage to the
boat, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for bread, 2<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for beer, 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for meat,
1<i>s.</i> 6¾<i>d.</i> for eight hens, and 6<i>d.</i> for fuel. On 24 December,
they paid 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for bread, 2<i>s.</i> for beer, 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>
for herrings and other fish, 9<i>d.</i> for eels, 3<i>d.</i> for porterage
from the boat at Lincoln, 6½<i>d.</i> for fuel and
candles, and 8<i>d.</i> for beds at Lincoln.</p>

<p>Tuesday, being Christmas Day, was spent quietly
<a name="png.166" id="png.166" href="#png.166"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>158<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at Lincoln. Their expenses for the day were 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for bread, 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> for beer, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for meat, 1<i>s.</i> 1¼<i>d.</i>
for five hens, 7½<i>d.</i> for candles and fuel, and 8<i>d.</i> for
beds.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 26 December, the party travelled
to Torksey, making the journey in two boats
hired at Lincoln. On this day, they paid 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
for the hire of the boats, 3<i>d.</i> for porterage to the
boats, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for bread, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for beer, 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> for
meat, 7<i>d.</i> for eggs, 4<i>d.</i> for fuel and candles, and 8<i>d.</i>
for beds at Torksey.</p>

<p>The next two days, Thursday and Friday, 27 and
28 December, were occupied in the journey from
Torksey to York, which was made in a large boat
hired at Torksey. On 27 December, they paid 6<i>s.</i>
for the hire of this boat, 2<i>d.</i> for porterage to the boat
at Torksey, 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for bread, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for beer, 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
for meat. On 28 December, they paid 1<i>s.</i> for bread,
1<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> for beer, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for herrings and other fish,
and 2<i>d.</i> for porterage of their goods at York.</p>

<p>The total cost of the journey came to <i>£</i>4. 5<i>s.</i> 8½<i>d.</i>,
and this was repaid to the warden from the royal
exchequer on 31 December. On the opposite page
is a summary of the daily expenditure described
above.</p>

<p>There are no records of the expenses of the
Society during the time the members were at York;
but presumably while there, they were treated as
<a name="png.168" id="png.168" href="#png.168"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>members of the royal household. Their visit, however,
was not devoid of incident since a warrant
was issued against one of them, Robert de Beverley,
for having joined with the prior of the preaching
friars of Pontefract in an assault on a certain William
Hardy: the student was left behind at York,
and there disappears from our history. Two other
members of the House, Edward de Kingston and
David de Winchester, were also left in the city, of
whom probably at least one was concerned in this
disturbance. One new member, Warin Trot, was
admitted at York. These changes reduced the
numbers to thirty-one. Of these thirty-one members,
twenty-one, under the guidance of John de Aston,
came back to Cambridge on the festival of
St Fabian and St Sebastian (<i>i.e.</i> 20 January), while
the warden and the remaining nine scholars, among
whom Trot was included, arrived on 9 February,
and from these dates their stipends in Cambridge
during the Lent Term, 1320, were reckoned.</p>

<p>Why the king summoned the members of the
House to York at so considerable cost I cannot say,
but I think the detailed statement of how most of
them travelled and their expenses on the journey
are interesting.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">I have</span> been asked to take you round Trinity
College to-morrow, and by way of preface to say
to-night something about its history. The first of
these tasks, to anyone who lives here, is not difficult,
but it is far from easy to give, in forty minutes,
a sketch of a history covering centuries of academic
life and involving references to the lives of many
distinguished scholars and men of affairs. If I confined
myself to an account of the buildings the
problem would be simpler, but though they must
form the chief topic of our talk to-morrow, I would
prefer to-day to say something about the growth
of the College. On these lines then I proceed,
though necessarily in an incomplete way, to state
the outline of our story.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">2.</span> Trinity College was founded in 1546, just
about half-way back in the history of the University.
Of those pre-Trinity days I will only say that
the University arose about the end of the twelfth
century, and that it was nearly a hundred years
after its establishment before the first college was
<a name="png.170" id="png.170" href="#png.170"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>founded. Colleges were erected for the benefit of
selected scholars who were maintained at the expense
of the foundation, and throughout the middle
ages, most of the students lived in Private Hostels.
In Tudor times undergraduates who paid their own
expenses were admitted to colleges, and finally, every
student was required to be a member of one of
these Houses: the peculiar collegiate character of
Oxford and Cambridge dates from this change.
I need hardly add that women were not (and are
not) admissible as members of the University, and
that in former days teachers and students alike
were unmarried.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">3.</span> Towards the close of his reign, Henry VIII
determined to found a college at Cambridge which
should promote his views on religion and the new
learning. He decided to use for the purpose the
buildings and land occupied or owned by two of the
chief medieval colleges, King’s Hall and Michael-House.
Accordingly, under parliamentary powers,
he compelled those Societies to surrender to him
their charters and possessions, purchased such small
parts of our present Great Court as did not belong
to them, and gave all this property to his new
college together with large revenues from religious
houses which he had recently dissolved. The proceedings
were high-handed, but we may say that
the result justified him. It is believed that, during
<a name="png.171" id="png.171" href="#png.171"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>these proceedings, the university careers of a few of
the students, at any rate of King’s Hall, were not
interrupted, and that thus our academic life runs
without a break from the days of Edward II to the
present time. Most of the buildings of Michael-House
have now disappeared, but our connection
with King’s Hall is still evident through the remains
of its Cloister Court, our Great Gate which
bears an inscription commemorating the permanent
establishment of King’s Hall by Edward III, and
our Clock Tower on which is a statue of that
monarch. To this group of buildings we must first
direct attention to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">4.</span> Trinity was far larger than the colleges to
whose buildings and property it succeeded. Of
course it has had ups and downs in its career, but
it has generally occupied and still occupies a predominant
position in the University. Thus in 1564,
its residents numbered three hundred and six out of
a total of one thousand two hundred and sixty-seven
in the University, while last October [1905],
it had five hundred and sixty-eight undergraduates
out of a total of two thousand eight hundred and
thirty-five in the University, and two hundred resident
graduates out of one thousand and five in the
University: we now confine our normal entry to
under two hundred a year, and as long as this is so,
our numbers cannot exceed a certain limit which we
<a name="png.172" id="png.172" href="#png.172"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have long reached, so, as the University grows, the
percentage of students on our boards decreases.
The College has always recognized that it was its
duty to be a centre of learning as well as one of
higher education, and thanks to its traditions and
the large number of resident fellows, it has been
able to fulfil this double duty.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">5.</span> For the first few years after its foundation,
Trinity was occupied in settling the many problems
which arise in a new foundation. As far as accommodation
went, the buildings of King’s Hall and
Michael-House were connected, and sufficed for immediate
needs. Naturally the protestant character
of the foundation given by Henry was emphasized
by the advisers of Edward VI, the altar in the chapel
being removed and a communion table set up in
Huguenot fashion in the middle of the building.
Queen Mary increased the foundation, and took a
warm interest in its affairs; of course the Roman
service was then restored. Under Elizabeth the
Anglican services were resumed, and she completed
the erection of the present chapel which had been
begun by her sister: it stands to-day externally
much in its original form, though the interior scheme
of decoration is different. We may leave till to-morrow
the description of it and college doings
connected therewith. This first chapter of our
history ends in 1560 when the constitution of the
<a name="png.173" id="png.173" href="#png.173"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>165<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>College was definitely established in a form which
remained practically unaltered till 1861.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">6.</span> The next decade was critical. Many of
those who had adopted the reformed religion desired
further changes on presbyterian lines, and
Cambridge, which had taken so prominent a part
in the reformation, was their chief intellectual
stronghold. Their leader was Cartwright, a fellow
of Trinity, and their chief opponent was Whitgift,
the master of the College: thus a contest of national
importance was mixed up with college politics and
carried on partly within the college walls. Whitgift’s
powers as master were large, and he strained them
to the utmost to remove from the House those who
opposed him; times, however, were revolutionary
and public opinion condoned and even approved
his actions. At any rate victory remained with
him and his party in the College, the University,
and the State, and the position of the Church of
England between Rome and Geneva is that for
which he fought.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">7.</span> Whitgift acted as tutor to some of the
students, among whom were Francis Bacon and his
brother Anthony: you will see the portrait of the
former (as also that of Whitgift) to-morrow, together
with those of his contemporaries, Edward Coke subsequently
the great lawyer, and Robert Devereux
earl of Essex the ill-fated favourite of Elizabeth.
<a name="png.174" id="png.174" href="#png.174"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>166<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>By a happy accident some of Whitgift’s tutorial
ledgers have been preserved, and we have in them
details of the expenditure of his pupils, which, combined
with information from other sources, enables
us to give a fairly complete account of their daily
work, prayers, meals, and amusements<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn30" id="fna30" name="fna30">30</a></sup>. A usual
age for commencing residence was fifteen or sixteen,
and it would seem that students then (though of
course subject in many things to reasonable restraints)
were allowed that liberty of action which in
my opinion is, even though sometimes misused, an
essential feature of university education as opposed
to the control of the pupil’s doings in every hour of
the day which is common in many schools. In 1577
Whitgift accepted a bishopric: an eloquent farewell
sermon preached in College from 2 Corinthians,
chapter 13, verse 2, revealed sincere affection
for the place and moved his audience, “insomuch
that there were scarce any drie eyes to be found
amongst the whole number.” He left the House
prosperous and of high repute.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">8.</span> In 1593 Nevile was appointed master, and
took in hand the needed reconstruction of the
<a name="png.175" id="png.175" href="#png.175"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>167<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>buildings. It had from the first been recognized
that the site offered opportunities for the erection of
buildings worthy of the reputation of the College,
and he realized how much the effect would depend
on making the court large, and above all on keeping
the chamber frontage only two storeys high with
attics above. The Great Court as it stands to-day
is his creation; the only obvious defect in it is the
ugly block built in the south-west corner in 1770
to replace Nevile’s set of combination rooms which
had an elevation agreeing generally with that of the
master’s lodge, but enriched by a large projecting
trefoil oriel. The hall, kitchens, combination rooms,
and lodge form another group of buildings to which
we must pay attention to-morrow: the first two of
these are in the form left by Nevile. The blazoned
glass in the hall and our collection of pictures in
these rooms, especially the portraits of Henry VIII,
Mary, and Elizabeth, all of whom have played an
important part in our history, will well repay your
study. Nevile also built, at his own cost, part of the
court situated on the west side of the hall. This too
we shall see to-morrow on our way to the library:
in his day, the court was closed on the river side by
a low wall, in the middle of which stood the stone
gateway now used as the entrance to the College
from Trinity Lane, and beyond this wall were the
tennis courts and paddocks.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber"><a name="png.176" id="png.176" href="#png.176"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>168<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>9.</span> The prince of Wales, afterwards Charles I,
came to the College to inspect these alterations,
and he was followed later by James I. These visits
are commemorated by the statues of James, his
wife, and Charles placed on the west side of the
Great Gate. The king was so pleased with his
entertainment that he repeated his visit on three
subsequent occasions. Of Nevile, one of his contemporaries
wrote, “He never had his like for a
splendid courteous and bounteous gentleman,”
and the College still gratefully honours his memory.
He was trusted and esteemed by Elizabeth, and
when dying she selected him to carry to Scotland
the fateful letter in which she nominated James I
to succeed her. If you go into the dining room of
the lodge you will see Nevile’s portrait, hung in the
place of honour over the mantelpiece, representing
him as holding this letter in one hand.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">10.</span> You must not think that under Nevile’s
rule the energies of the College were wholly directed
to material ends. In a memorandum of 1607 on
the use of college emoluments for students, he
was able to say that of the higher church officials
of the day, eleven deans, seven bishops, and the two
archbishops, were drawn from Trinity. In academic
distinctions, in legal appointments, and in
statesmanship its records were equally satisfactory:
so the College was worthily maintaining its tradition
<a name="png.177" id="png.177" href="#png.177"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of service in church and state. Under his immediate
successors the College entered on a period of steady
prosperity. In the next generation, however, the
shadows of the civil disturbances of the seventeenth
century began to fall; theological disputes increased,
scholarship in other subjects received but scanty
attention, and a general slackness in intellectual
pursuits was visible, though it is fair to say that
among the students of the time were three or four
who later deservedly acquired reputation as poets.
Among the latter I particularize George Herbert,
Abraham Cowley, and Andrew Marvell; Dryden
entered a few years later.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">11.</span> On the outbreak of civil war the town was
occupied by the parliamentary forces, troops were
quartered in the College, and a good deal of damage
done to the fabric. In 1644 a large number of the
fellows were expelled, their places being filled by
zealots of but slight education. It may be put to
the credit of a few who were left, notably Duport
and Ray, that in this time of stress they devoted
themselves to maintaining the standard of scholarship.
On the restoration such of the expelled
fellows as were still alive and unmarried resumed
office. They decided that there should be no retaliations,
and that all those nominated to fellowships
under the commonwealth should be allowed
to remain, provided only they did not preach in
<a name="png.178" id="png.178" href="#png.178"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>170<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the chapel unless they were members of the Church
of England: that was a noble reply to the wrongs
suffered.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">12.</span> The College took pride in resuming at once
its position in the world of letters and science, and
the following years are famous for the work of Pearson
and Barrow, two great divines of the time, and
above all of Isaac Newton. The influence of the
last-named philosopher on the studies and intellectual
life of Cambridge was far reaching. His
discoveries in pure mathematics, mechanics, physics,
and dynamical astronomy were of the utmost importance,
and made Cambridge the centre of
mathematical work in England. I will show you
to-morrow the rooms he occupied and in which he
wrote his famous <cite>Principia</cite>. The staircase on
which these rooms are situated has had other distinguished
occupants: the rooms on the ground floor
on the right-hand side on entering it were occupied
by Thackeray, and subsequently by the late
astronomer-royal; those on the opposite side by
Macaulay; the rooms on the first floor next the
gate which once had been occupied by Isaac Newton,
were used later by Lightfoot, the theologian,
and Jebb, the Greek scholar; and those on the
opposite side by Sir James Frazer, who has done so
much to investigate the beliefs of primitive man.
This is an interesting group of men, but in fact
<a name="png.179" id="png.179" href="#png.179"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>171<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there are few rooms in College which have not
been inhabited at some time by those who have
made their names famous.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">13.</span> Barrow held the mastership from 1673 to
1677. On his initiative the College erected, on the
west side of Nevile’s Court, the magnificent library
which is now stored with literary treasures. This is
another building to which we must pay attention to-morrow,
and with it we may associate the adjoining
chambers. From the close of the seventeenth century
onwards we can describe life in College, especially
among undergraduates, in considerable detail. The
usual age of entry had risen to seventeen or eighteen.
To the dons the College offered a comfortable home
until an opportunity occurred of taking a college
living, and it must be admitted that some were
beginning to be content to consider it as nothing
more. Materials for the history of the time and the
following century have been published by Christopher
Wordsworth.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">14.</span> Towards the close of the seventeenth century,
the number of entries fell; this was attributed,
and no doubt correctly, to the rise to office in College
of those fellows appointed by mandatory letters from
James II—he having filled every fellowship that became
vacant during his reign. The history of the
Society during the early years of the eighteenth
century may be dismissed with the briefest notice,
<a name="png.180" id="png.180" href="#png.180"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>172<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for college energies were largely occupied by domestic
disputes, and the number of residents still
further decreased: these misfortunes were mainly
due to the scandals inseparably associated with the
name of Bentley. Bentley held the mastership
from 1700 to 1742: his critical work can hardly be
over-praised, but his career here was marked by
malversations and many dishonourable transactions.
The only scholars of the time I need mention
are Cotes and Robert Smith who were mathematicians
of repute. The latter of these scholars, when
master, did something to restore orderly government
and discipline.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">15.</span> It was not until near the close of the
century that the College recovered from the taint of
Bentley’s misrule, and scholarship again flourished
within our walls: among the residents of the time
was Porson, whose wit and conversation must have
been delightful features of the High Table of his
day—he lived in K 5, Great Court. Mathematics
now afforded the chief avenue to distinction, but
some acquaintance with classics and moral philosophy
was also obligatory. This period is famous
for the number of eminent judges educated in the
College: the strict training in formal logic and geometry
required for success in the mathematical tripos
being especially favourable to legal work. Out of
eleven such Trinity judges of the time the names
<a name="png.181" id="png.181" href="#png.181"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of Tindal, Pollock, Maule, Lyndhurst, Wensleydale,
and Cranworth are still remembered. Socially,
manners were generally coarser than at any time
during the previous century or than later; though
the revival of religion under the influence of Simeon
did something to ameliorate matters.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">16.</span> Unlike its predecessor the nineteenth century
was one of unbroken progress in college achievements
and reputation. Near its commencement two
internal changes of some importance were introduced
in the imposition of an entrance examination
test and of a limit to the number of those admitted.
None the less our numbers increased, and in
1823–25, another court (the New Court) was built on
the south side of that erected by Nevile. At this
time, conspicuous among the resident fellows were
Sedgwick the geologist, Peacock the mathematician,
Scholefield, Hare, and Thirlwall, Macaulay the historian,
and Airy the astronomer: it would be difficult
to exaggerate their influence on the intellectual life
of the College and University. The undergraduate
society a few years later also numbered a group of
men of exceptional power, notably Trench afterwards
archbishop of Dublin, Thackeray, Fitzgerald,
Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton), Spedding, Arthur
Hallam, Kinglake the historian, the three Tennysons
(Alfred, Charles, and Frederick), and Thompson;
while a little later came Alford, Lushington, Grote,
<a name="png.182" id="png.182" href="#png.182"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>174<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Tom Taylor, Burnand, and Francis Galton. Materials
left by these men, and books like J. M. F. Wright’s
<cite>Alma Mater</cite>, C. A. Bristed’s <cite>Five years in an English
University</cite>, Leslie Stephen’s <cite>Sketches from Cambridge
by a Don</cite>, and W. Everett’s <cite>On the Cam</cite>, give us full
information of college life during the middle of the
century. In connection with the social life of the
early half of the nineteenth century I should note
that athletic clubs now began to be formed—the
First Trinity Boat Club, constituted in 1825, being
the earliest. These societies led to the formulation
of definite rules for various forms of sport, and to
much more attention being paid to out-door games.
The subsequent growth of organized recreations of
this kind, increasingly developed in recent years, will
strike the future historian as one of the outstanding
features of the last century.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">17.</span> In 1840 Whewell was appointed master.
He was of commanding abilities and exercised extraordinary
influence: to him more than to any other
single individual is due that development of scientific
studies at Cambridge which has been so marked in
the recent history of the University. Under him, the
prince of Wales, afterwards Edward VII, was entered
at the College, and later showed his appreciation of
its influence by sending his eldest son, the duke of
Clarence, here. Whewell erected at his own cost the
two courts on the east side of Trinity Street, the
<a name="png.183" id="png.183" href="#png.183"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>175<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rents being used to encourage the study of International
Law in the University. During his mastership
the old order began to crumble, and new ideals
of education, study, and research arose. The Elizabethan
statutes were replaced by transitional statutes
in 1844 and 1861, and these in turn were replaced
by others in 1882, under which the College is now
governed.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">18.</span> Whewell died in 1866, and was succeeded as
master by Thompson, and he in 1886 by Butler.
With their masterships we come to the affairs of to-day.
The 1882 statutes opened a new chapter in our
history; restrictions on the marriage of fellows were
removed, and successful teachers thus encouraged to
remain in residence; incidentally, this created a new
social atmosphere. In this and other ways the conditions
of academic life were considerably changed.
We need not, however, shun a comparison with
older times: if you want to see how freely Trinity
during the late Victorian period spent itself in the
public service look down any list of judges, bishops,
statesmen, colonial governors, and civil servants of
the time, and in all you will find many Trinity men
conspicuous. Confining ourselves strictly to academic
work in Cambridge and to those who have now [1906]
passed away, I may mention the names of Clerk
Maxwell in physics, of Cayley in mathematics, of
Munro and Jebb in classics, of Thompson in Greek
<a name="png.184" id="png.184" href="#png.184"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>176<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>philosophy, of Sidgwick in ethics, and of Westcott,
Lightfoot, and Hort in theology: all of these were
fellows of the College, and professors in the University.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">19.</span> This is a bare summary of a complex story.
Of the spirit that actuates the College, of all that
makes it a living Society, I have said little. In
truth, these are incapable of analysis. The charm
that the place perennially exercises on those who,
generation after generation, make it their home, the
affection it inspires, are intangible: they exist, there
are but few members of the House who have not
felt them, and perhaps that is all I need say on this
aspect of our history.</p>

 /><small>THE BEGINNINGS OF THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITY.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">The</span> problems connected with the beginnings of
the University of Cambridge and the conditions
of life in its early days have always interested
me. Much is uncertain and open to various readings<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn31" id="fna31" name="fna31">31</a></sup>,
but the following is a summary of the story,
as it appears to me.</p>

<p>First, as to the site of the University. About the
end of the eleventh century, Cambridge was little
more than a village concentrated round St Peter’s
church, having separate hamlets in its vicinity,
one near St Benet’s church and the other at Newnham:
at that time there was nothing to suggest the
likelihood of its being chosen by students as a place
where they might live and work in security. During
the next century, however, it became of considerable
importance. This was due to several causes.
The chief of these were the castle erected in it by
William the Conqueror to overawe the fen-men; its
geographical location which gave it command of the
<a name="png.188" id="png.188" href="#png.188"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>180<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>river passage by which most of the traffic between
the midlands and the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk
went; its position as a port of entry for small sea-going
vessels coming from Lynn, of which a relic still
survives in a bonded warehouse on the banks of the
Cam; its vicinity to Sturbridge common on which
came to be held one of the chief annual fairs in the
kingdom; and lastly the establishment here of the
large monastic Houses of the Augustin Canons, of
the Brethren of St John’s Hospital, and of the Nuns of
St Rhadegund: it would seem also that it became<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn32" id="fna32" name="fna32">32</a></sup>,
maybe under the authority of the secular canons of
St Giles, the seat of a grammar-school or schools.
By 1200 the town had spread from castle-end to
where Christ’s, Peterhouse, and Queens’ now stand,
and along the east side of the river there were
numerous small wharves, locally known as hythes.
The writs of Henry I and Henry II and the charter
of John bear witness to its importance in their reigns,
but later this tended to diminish relatively to other
towns.</p>

<p>The Universities of Cambridge and Oxford
were initiated near the end of the twelfth century,
both arising in towns free from disorder and where
accommodation for students was obtainable. It
was a time when men of scholarly tastes, especially
<a name="png.189" id="png.189" href="#png.189"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>181<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>those resident in religious houses, were conscious
of their ignorance of recent developments in theology
as set out by Peter Lombard and in canon law,
and were keen to study these subjects and scholastic
logic. Schools to meet these needs arose in Cambridge
and Oxford and became permanent. Like
centres of instruction were established in other
places, but for one reason or another did not survive
long as degree-granting corporations.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the University of
Cambridge began with a few teachers taking up
their residence in the town, giving instruction, and
attracting students and other teachers, or whether
it started ready-made by a migration of a body of
discontented teachers and students from some existing
school. I believe the former view to be
correct. If so, we may reasonably assume that a
considerable proportion of the earliest adult students
were previously living in monastic houses
here or in the neighbouring fenland monasteries at
Ely, Peterborough, or Croyland. It has been suggested
that at first the lectures were given in the
local grammar-schools: this is probable, and would
fit in with the secular organization of the University
and the fact that boys learning Latin grammar
(glomerels) were reckoned among its students. Probably
the movement was started with the sanction
and direct encouragement of the bishop of Ely,
<a name="png.190" id="png.190" href="#png.190"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>182<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>certainly it was not directly monastic, and more
likely the teachers were secular clerks and not
monks. I conjecture that at first the lecturers were
strangers to the locality, but this in no way implies
that a fragment of another university, students
as well as teachers, migrated here as an organized
body.</p>

<p>Whatever the origin of the University, its members
organized themselves for mutual aid and protection
as a <i>Studium</i> on the model of that at Paris,
with which it seems later to have been frequently
in touch. If we may trust ancient traditions quoted
by Bulaeus and Peacock, the early University had
also some connection with the studium of Orleans:
this is possible but speculative. Bologna represented
another type of organization which, however, was
not adopted anywhere in England. The University
of Cambridge existed in working order in 1209, and
in my opinion its origin may be safely assigned to
some time in the previous twenty years.</p>

<p>Of its external history during the century following
its organization we know little: we read of
its chancellor in 1225, of French students coming
to it in 1229, of special privileges conferred by the
crown in 1231 and 1251, of its recognition by the
pope in 1233, and finally of a papal grant in 1318—exceptional
in extent—of all rights which were or
could be enjoyed by any university in Christendom.
<a name="png.191" id="png.191" href="#png.191"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>183<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Oxford went through somewhat similar stages. The
two universities were closely connected, and by 1333
their position had become so firmly established that
they agreed not to recognize any other studium in
the kingdom, and in fact after that year no other
university was established in England until less than
a century ago.</p>

<p>Originally the main source of university authority
was the body of active teachers (regents)
acting with the concurrence of the chancellor who
represented the bishop of Ely; their grouping in
faculties was an obvious development, and probably
took place early in the thirteenth century. Resident
graduates who had ceased to teach (non-regents)
were allowed a voice on matters of property,
rights, and privileges. The establishment of
monasteries and colleges with administrative officers
tended to retain in residence graduates who were
not lecturing; through them the house of non-regents
grew in power, and finally in many questions
obtained concurrent jurisdiction with that of
the regents—the result was a very complex constitution.
At first the University had no buildings of its
own; the regent and non-regent houses met in
St Benet’s or St Mary’s church, and lectures were
given wherever accommodation could be obtained.
After this digression I return to the position of the
students in the early University.</p>

<p><a name="png.192" id="png.192" href="#png.192"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Numerous monasteries were established in Cambridge
during the thirteenth century, and from this
I infer that the number of members of the religious
Orders studying in the University steadily
increased during that century. Of monastic Houses
in Cambridge previous to the foundation of the
University I have already mentioned those of the
Augustin Canons, founded in connection with St
Giles’ church, about 1092, and moved in 1112 to
Barnwell where their priory became in time one
of the largest conventual buildings in England,
and of the Austin Brethren of Frost’s or St John’s
Hospital, built about 1135 on ground now occupied
by St John’s College. Shortly after the organization
of a studium in the town, five important Orders
established Houses here. These were the Franciscan
or Grey Friars, who, from their first home
situated near the present Divinity Schools and used
from 1224 to 1294, removed in 1294 to a site now
occupied by Sidney Sussex College, where their
church was one of the conspicuous architectural
features of medieval Cambridge; the Dominican or
Black Friars, who built in 1274 on ground now
occupied by Emmanuel College; the Carmelite or
White Friars, who, having previously lived in
houses at Chesterton and Newnham, removed in
1290 to a site now occupied by Queens’ and King’s
Colleges; the Augustine Friars, who built, about
<a name="png.193" id="png.193" href="#png.193"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>1290, a home on or near ground now occupied
by the university examination halls and lecture
rooms, in the basement of which some fragments
of the old friary may be found; and the Sempringham
or White Canons, who about 1290 obtained
possession of St Edmund’s Priory which had been
built before 1278 near the Trumpington Gate. The
Houses of the Bethlehem Friars, opened in 1257,
of the Friars of the Sack, opened in 1258, and of
the Friars of St Mary, opened in 1273, were suppressed
in 1307, and probably were never important
foundations. I believe that the presence in Cambridge
of these great establishments, always housing
a certain number of students, gave stability to the
nascent University, and tended to prevent its dissipation
in times of stress: this is a point in our early
history which is sometimes overlooked. Students
from Houses of the Benedictine or Black Monks
were also sent to Cambridge, but until 1428 they
seem to have had no special home of their own: in
that year the Order built for them a hostel known
as Buckingham House which now forms part of
the first court of Magdalene College.</p>

<p>These conventual Houses were outside town
and university authority, but their wealth and
position made them influential. Striking evidence
of this is afforded by the facts that they secured to
their members the right to proceed direct to degrees
<a name="png.194" id="png.194" href="#png.194"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in divinity without graduating in arts—a privilege
not granted to students in law or medicine—and that
at every congregation of the University the senior
religious doctor present could veto the offer of any
grace and so block all business. These privileges
suggest that monastic students were the dominant
class in the early days of the University. They were,
however, naturally distrusted by other students, for
admittedly they owed allegiance to outside bodies,
and no man can serve two masters. By the end of
the thirteenth century the monastic movement had
spent its force, and thenceforth the religious students
took a constantly decreasing share in university
activities; of course they disappeared at the reformation,
when the monasteries throughout the country
were suppressed.</p>

<p>I come next to the question of the secular
students in arts, most or all of whom would be clerks
in major or minor orders. Rejecting the migration
theory of the origin of the University, I do not suppose
that in its earliest days these secular students
were numerous, for the vicinity cannot have provided
many such men, but as soon as the University
acquired reputation as a centre of higher teaching
they would be attracted to it from a wide area, and
their numbers would be increased by many glomerels
who would continue their course as students
in arts. In the course of the thirteenth century
<a name="png.195" id="png.195" href="#png.195"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>187<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>these secular students became strong enough to
assert themselves against the position and privileges
assumed by the religious students, and after
that century graces were constantly passed (<i>ex. gr.</i>
in 1303) to prevent monastic interference in academic
affairs, or (as in 1369) to limit the number of
monastic graduates.</p>

<p>A non-graduate student in arts was, before
admission, expected to know Latin, and, on admission,
apprenticed to a master or doctor who
acted as a tutor in scholastic matters: in 1276 this
system of apprenticeship was made compulsory.
The full medieval course lasted several years.
Students who entered as boys stayed, if they took
the full course, till they were grown men, gradually
taking up teaching as part of their course of study.
The bachelors may have assisted in the education of
the younger arts students and of the glomerels who
are mentioned below, but normally instruction in
the arts course was given by masters, and in the
higher faculties by doctors. The degree of master
was a license to teach, and newly created masters
were required to teach and to reside for two years
(or later at least one year) for that purpose. This
pre-reformation scheme is in marked contrast to
the modern plan where the students enter as young
men, all of about the same age, with a normal
course lasting three years or so, and with their
<a name="png.196" id="png.196" href="#png.196"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>188<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>studies sharply differentiated from those of a limited
number of post-graduate and research students
and of a separate body of teachers. Mullinger estimated
that during the medieval period the number
of resident regents varied from one hundred to two
hundred, and the number of students (apparently
exclusive of monastic students) never exceeded two
thousand of whom the great majority were of
humble birth; no doubt there were wide variations
in the numbers at different times.</p>

<p>The history of Guilds in the University cannot
be given with any certainty. It may be that in
the early years of the University most secular students
and teachers from any particular locality were
associated together as a guild, and perhaps every
student on arrival was expected to join his local guild,
and through it become a member of the University.
The guilds imposed on their members definite rules
for their conduct in relation to one another, and
enforced such regulations by means of money fines,
refusal of assistance, and in extreme cases expulsion.
The relations between the members of different
guilds were, however, often unfriendly or worse;
in particular there was constant friction between
the guilds connected with localities north and south
of the Trent. It has been suggested that at one
time one of the proctors represented the cis-trentine
guilds and the other the trans-trentine guilds: this
<a name="png.197" id="png.197" href="#png.197"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>189<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seems to have been the case at Oxford, but there is
no evidence of such a custom at Cambridge where,
according to Peacock, these trentine disputes were
less violent than at the sister University.</p>

<p>We may take it that the master to whom
a secular non-graduate student was apprenticed
looked after his studies, and probably officers of
the guild to which he belonged looked after him
when sick or maltreated. In other matters, however,
he was left to take care of himself, and thus was
constantly liable to extortion. To meet this evil,
the University early obtained powers enabling it to
settle, without consulting the citizens, various local
matters such as the prices of lodging and food.</p>

<p>Besides students in arts there was also another
class of secular students consisting of boys,
known as glomerels (grammarians) and rhetoricians,
who were under a special officer of the University
called the master of glomery. I conjecture that
originally these were the boys at the local grammar-schools,
that after the foundation of the University
such boys were regularly treated as glomerel members
of it, and that for this reason we hear nothing
more of the local grammar-schools which had at
first supplied them: most students of this type must
have lived at home and come from the town or immediate
neighbourhood. I suppose that in later
times the number of glomerels was swollen by the
<a name="png.198" id="png.198" href="#png.198"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>entry among them of students who had come to
Cambridge, and were found to be ignorant of Latin
grammar, and so inadmissible to the arts faculty.</p>

<p>The chief study of a glomerel was Latin grammar,
and on attaining reasonable proficiency in it he
could change over to the arts faculty if he wished.
If a student continued in the glomerel faculty, the
degree of master in grammar (or rhetoric) was open
to him, but in processions of the University, such
graduates took a lower place than students in arts,
and their inferior position was emphasized by a
statute which, while regulating the attendance of
regents at the funeral of a regent master or student
in arts, stated that graduates and scholars in grammar
were not entitled to such recognition—<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Illis
tantummodo exceptis, qui artem solam docent vel
audiunt grammaticam, ad quorum exequias nisi ex
devotione non veniant supradicti</i>.</p>

<p>The ceremony of graduation in grammar has
often been described: it involved the beating openly
in the schools of a shrewd boy obtained by the university
officers for the purpose, and the presentation
to the new master of a ferule: this suggests that the
course was regarded as a training for a schoolmaster’s
career, it also facilitated admission to
orders. As time passed, the glomerels, originally
forming a large and important section of the University
here and at Oxford, decreased in numbers,
<a name="png.199" id="png.199" href="#png.199"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>191<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and in the latter half of the fifteenth century they
ceased to be of much importance in academic life.
The faculty of rhetoric was constituted on similar
lines to that of grammar, and practically treated as
part of it. The last degrees in rhetoric and grammar
of which we have notice were conferred in 1493
and 1548 respectively: probably the office of master
of glomery fell into disuse about the beginning of
the sixteenth century, though it is possible that it
was held by Sir John Cheke as late as 1547.</p>

<p>The evils consequent on allowing inexperienced
students, some of whom were quite young, to fend
for themselves in all matters outside the schools
were obvious, and it was not long before steps were
taken to improve matters by the foundation of
colleges and the licensing of private hostels.</p>

<p>Colleges were designed for selected scholars
partly to provide assistance for them, and partly
to protect them from pressure to join a monastic
Order: the advantages offered being shelter,
a common sitting room properly warmed, regular
meals, the use of books, and general supervision.
The earliest attempt to provide aid and protection
of this kind for certain scholars was made, about
1275, by Hugh de Balsham, who arranged for their
reception as members of Frost’s Hospital; but there
were constant quarrels between the two sides of
the House, and in 1284 he dissolved the union and
<a name="png.200" id="png.200" href="#png.200"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>moved the secular students to a building (Peterhouse)
of their own. Other similar foundations were soon
created: the King’s Scholars (later incorporated as
King’s Hall) in 1317, Michael-House in 1324, Clare
in 1325, Pembroke in 1347, Gonville in 1348, Trinity
Hall in 1350, and Corpus Christi in 1352. Every new
college that was established provided fresh definite
ties with the locality, and rendered less likely the
break-up of the University and the scattering of its
members—a serious risk to which in early days it
was always subject. Then came an interval of nearly
a hundred years, but in the fifteenth century the
collegiate movement recommenced, and we have
the foundation of God’s House in 1439, of King’s in
1441, of Queens’ in 1448 and 1465, of St Catharine’s
in 1473, and of Jesus in 1496. In the sixteenth
century we have the larger and more ambitious
foundations of Christ’s in 1505, St John’s in 1511,
Magdalene in 1519, Trinity in 1546, Emmanuel in
1584, and Sidney Sussex in 1596.</p>

<p>The colleges were intended for picked scholars.
In the course of the fourteenth century the problem
of the care of other students was taken up, and they
were forbidden to live in lodgings selected by themselves
and under no external supervision. To provide
for them, the University licensed private hostels
which were managed by masters of arts on lines
somewhat similar to boarding houses in public schools
<a name="png.201" id="png.201" href="#png.201"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>193<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to-day. Thenceforth throughout the middle ages the
majority of undergraduates resided in these hostels.
Caius gave the names and sites of twenty-seven private
hostels which he had known and all of which
closed their doors during his life, the last in 1540:
Fuller enumerated thirty-four hostels and two “inns”
while his editor mentioned fourteen other hostels,
but some of these certainly ought not to be included
under the term. Perhaps we may say that the
number open at anyone time rarely exceeded thirty
or fell short of twenty: some were cheap, some expensive;
some were well managed, others not so.
After the development of these hostels the guilds
decreased in importance, and finally disappeared.</p>

<p>With the establishment of colleges and private
hostels the University was fairly launched on its
career in a form which lasted till the middle half of
the sixteenth century. My object was to state how,
in my opinion, it originally took shape, and I do not
propose here to follow its history further.</p>

 /><small>DISCIPLINE.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">This</span> paper contains some extracts from my notebooks
on the way in which university and college
discipline was maintained in former days at
Cambridge. The records on the subject are scanty,
but I think the facts are worth putting together in
a connected form. There is no reason to suppose
that the practices of different colleges varied materially,
and if in the later period I have taken examples
from the records of Trinity it is only because
I have had easier access to them.</p>

<p>In the history of university discipline and social
customs abrupt changes are not to be expected, and
none such are noticeable in the transition from the
medieval period, <i>circ.</i> 1200 to 1525, through the
renaissance, <i>circ.</i> 1525 to 1640, and the period of
stagnation, <i>circ.</i> 1660 to 1820, to the present age
of reconstruction and extension. I begin naturally
with discipline in medieval Cambridge.</p>

<p>In the early days of the University the students
lodged in the town and were of all ages from twelve
or thirteen upwards. Except in strictly academic
matters, there was little or no supervision of their
conduct, and, outside the schools, grave disorders
<a name="png.203" id="png.203" href="#png.203"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were common; the University, however, claimed
power, when it chose, to take cognizance of all
offences contrary to good manners, and at any rate
in later days did so in serious cases. The regulations
at Cambridge and Oxford were so similar that
we may fairly draw illustrations from either University,
and the records of the chancellor’s court at
Oxford in the fifteenth century show that fines,
imprisonment, and, in extreme cases, expulsion
were customary penalties for serious offences against
university regulations and customs. I have no
doubt that earlier records, if extant, would be of
the same general character.</p>

<p>The first college to be founded at Cambridge was
Peterhouse which took its final form in 1284, and
during the next century several other similar Houses
were established: these societies were intended for
selected scholars. The problem of the control of
other students was met in the course of the fourteenth
century by preventing them from living in private
lodgings chosen by themselves, and thenceforth,
throughout the middle ages, those who came from a
distance were generally required to reside in private
hostels run by masters of arts on lines somewhat
similar to boarding houses in public schools to-day.
Besides the lay and secular students accommodated
in colleges, private hostels, and at their homes, there
were also in the medieval University a considerable
<a name="png.204" id="png.204" href="#png.204"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>196<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>number of “religious” students who were housed
in monasteries or monastic hostels. Some of the
colleges in later medieval times received as paying
members a few wealthy pensioners, parochial priests
in middle life, and even monks from distant convents,
but probably the number of such favoured
students was never large. With the establishment
of colleges and the organization of private hostels
discipline improved; inside their walls as well as in
the monastic hostels it is probable that order was
well maintained, but outside them, at least among
the students at private hostels, discipline was left to
the university authorities who did little or nothing
in the matter.</p>

<p>The colleges took seriously their responsibilities
for discipline, and all things contrary to good manners
and morals were prohibited. For the gravest
offences, such as contumacy, crimes of violence, and
heresy, expulsion was usually ordered. Among less
serious delinquencies, explicitly forbidden and therefore
we may assume not unknown, were bringing
strangers into the house, sleeping out, and absence
without leave; using insulting language, drunkenness,
gambling, and frequenting taverns; keeping
company with loose women; throwing missiles and
carrying arms; and the keeping of dogs, hawks,
falcons, and ferrets. In the regulations of many colleges,
a course of study was indicated, and directions
<a name="png.205" id="png.205" href="#png.205"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>given that idleness was to be punished. Regular
attendance at religious exercises was assumed, and
was explicitly directed on certain occasions: I suppose
that students performed such duties without
much external pressure, and I know no record
of the infliction of any penalty in early times for
non-attendance. In the middle ages Latin was
the language generally enforced, though occasionally
French was permitted; this remained the rule
until the seventeenth century. Conversation during
dinner and supper was forbidden in many colleges,
and of course was impossible in those cases where
some book was then read aloud. At King’s College,
jumping and ball throwing, and at Clare College
meetings in bedrooms for feasting and talking were
also forbidden. At a somewhat later date Caius
ordered his students to be in bed by eight o’clock
at night, but they made up for this by rising
very early in the morning. In general the punishment
for minor faults was left to the discretion
of the authorities. This was only reasonable, for
a medieval college was a mixed community of
lads and men, the members being of all ages from
about fourteen or fifteen upwards; and rules enforced
on boys of fourteen could not be applied
to men of twenty-three or twenty-four, who were
in fact already taking part in the teaching of the
junior scholars.</p>

<p><a name="png.206" id="png.206" href="#png.206"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>198<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>For all members, the ultimate penalty for the
gravest offences was expulsion. For less serious
misconduct, fines, restrictions on the food supplied,
impositions, and confinement within the walls, are
believed to have been common penalties, at any
rate for adolescents; but, as I explain below, I think
that corporal punishment was constantly inflicted
on non-adults in lieu of a fine, which indeed boys
would have had considerable difficulty in paying.
As far as the younger students and the bachelors
at colleges were concerned the extant regulations in
regard to their exercises, amusements, incomings
and outgoings, suggest that they were treated much
like the junior and senior boys in a rather strict
public school in the first half of the nineteenth
century; and perhaps the senior graduate members
were treated somewhat like residents in colleges at
the same period.</p>

<p>Membership of a college was a privilege confined,
in general, to scholars specially nominated, and no
doubt the standards of work and discipline there
were higher than in the private hostels. Naturally
we know less of life in these hostels, but it is likely
that disciplinary rules were originally made by or
with the approval of the elder residents, and that the
normal discipline in them was of the same general
character as that exercised in colleges, though, as
the members paid for themselves, money fines were
<a name="png.207" id="png.207" href="#png.207"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>199<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>possible and usual penalties, especially in the case
of the older members. There must have been more
variety in the discipline of hostels than of colleges,
and we may safely say that some hostels were well
conducted, others not so.</p>

<p>It is possible that finally the University claimed
the right to examine and supervise the internal regulations
of the hostels. A set of rules, thus enforced on
an unendowed hall at Oxford in the fifteenth century,
has been discovered and printed by Rashdall: they do
not differ much from those usual at a college, except
that some of the penalties specified are pecuniary,
and that the principal was given explicit permission,
if he wished, to flog a student, even though
the lad’s own master (<i>i.e.</i> the master to whom he
had been apprenticed) had certified that he had
already corrected him or was willing to do so.</p>

<p>Was corporal punishment commonly used in
medieval times? Until recently it was accepted
without argument that this was the case; and certainly
in the fifteenth century and later when we
get detailed information on the subject, the younger
students were subject to it. Rashdall, however, has
argued that the absence of its mention in earlier
times implies that the birch was unknown in the
ordinary university regulations till towards the end
of the sixteenth century or later, though he admits
in various places that glomerels were liable to it: his
<a name="png.208" id="png.208" href="#png.208"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>200<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>authority is accepted by Rait. It is true that in the
statutes given in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
birching is not mentioned explicitly, but, since
the punishments for petty offences are rarely specified
in detail, this proves nothing. In the fifteenth century
corporal punishment is mentioned as a recognized
penalty. For instance, the statutes given by
Henry VI to King’s College, Cambridge, prescribed
that scholars and young fellows might be punished
by stripes, and a year or two later, the statutes of
Magdalen College, Oxford, directed that the demies
should be subject to flogging. In later regulations
of various colleges, to some of which I refer below,
whipping is mentioned as a recognized punishment,
but often as one to which only the younger students
were liable.</p>

<p>I have already argued that in medieval colleges
discipline must have varied according to the age
of the offender, and I conjecture that adults were
never regularly subject to corporal punishment, but
that boys were always so, and that the use of the
rod was regarded as needing no explicit statutable
authority. Its employment was no strange thing,
for adult offenders against the law, apprentices, and
boys at school, were all flogged at times. And what
else, it has been well asked, could the authorities
do with a troublesome boy of fourteen? In general
a fine was impossible for he had no pocket-money.
<a name="png.209" id="png.209" href="#png.209"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>201<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Most of the colleges were designed for poor scholars,
and in such foundations usually the allowance for
commons was so small that without risk to health
any reduction for more than a day or two was
difficult; little leisure was allowed for recreation
or exercise, and thus heavy impositions were impossible;
and confinement to the precincts of the
House was so common that gating was no punishment.
A lad of seventeen or eighteen had more
liberty and privileges, and in general on reaching
that age was as safe from the chance of corporal
punishment as was a boy of the same age at a public
school fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar arguments apply to the private
hostels, and the regulations of an unendowed hall at
Oxford, to which I have already referred, show that
the use of the rod or birch was recognized there. If as
I suppose is likely, Clement Paston was at a private
hostel, we have a definite instance of the similar use
of the rod at Cambridge, for among the Paston letters
is one dated 28 January 1458 from Dame Agnes
Paston, about her boy, Clement, in which she says
“prey Grenefeld to send me feythfully word by
wrytyn who (how) Clement Paston hathe do his
dever i lerning. And if he hathe nought do well,
nor wyll nought amend, prey him that he wyll
trewly belassch (<i>i.e.</i> flog) him tyll he wyll amend,
and so ded the last Maystur and ye best, that ev’
<a name="png.210" id="png.210" href="#png.210"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he hadd at Cambrege.” Clement was born in 1442,
so he was then fifteen years old.</p>

<p>I asserted above that school-boys in the middle
ages were liable to the birch or cane. I suppose this
will not be questioned, but by way of parenthesis
I add that this liability seems to have been a well-established
practice for centuries. It goes back to
classical times for in the schools of Rome the less
serious offences were punished by the cane applied
to the hand, and graver faults by the birch applied
to the back; and there is a curious fresco at Herculaneum
of the application of the latter to a boy,
horsed by one schoolfellow and with his feet held by
another. The royal whipping boys in the courts of
Western Europe remind us that, at least vicariously,
princes were subject to this discipline as well as
commoners.</p>

<p>In more recent times the deeds of Busby
and Keate at Westminster and Eton respectively
are preserved in tradition, while the reputation
of Udall at an earlier time, <i>circ.</i> 1530, may be
gathered from the remarks of Thomas Tusser, a
choirboy at St Paul’s Cathedral, who subsequently
went to Eton: Tusser says, “From Paul’s I went,
to Eton sent, To learn straightways the Latin
phrase Where fifty-three stripes giv’n to me, at
once I had. For faults but small, or none at all,
It came to pass thus beat I was.” The similar
<a name="png.211" id="png.211" href="#png.211"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>vigour of Udall’s successor, Cox, is mentioned by
Ascham. In short, the old saw: “Spare the rod,
and spoil the child, Solomon said in accents mild,
Be it boy or be it maid, Whip ’em and wallop ’em
Solomon said” represented the current belief and
practice of former days; though the dictum attributed
to that king is stronger than the passage in
Proverbs, xiii, 24 warrants.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the colleges opened their
doors to the admission of pensioners and fellow-commoners.
Collegiate teaching and arrangements
were superior to those of the private hostels, and
before the middle of the century the latter had disappeared:
their revival was rendered impossible by
a regulation that membership of the University
should be confined to those who were members of
a college. Shortly afterwards it became the custom
not to require residence for degrees after the baccalaureate,
and thus a course limited to three or four
years became usual for the average student. These
changes were of far-reaching importance.</p>

<p>In the course of this century new statutes were
given to the University and colleges, and subsequently
we possess records, fairly complete, of the
domestic life of students. Early in the following
century, the average age of entry began to rise, and
before its close, it had become common for students
to defer entry until about seventeen years old.</p>

<p><a name="png.212" id="png.212" href="#png.212"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>204<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>University decrees regulating the conduct of
students in many matters now appear, notably one
in 1595 by Goad, then vice-chancellor, which gives
a summary of what was expected. Expulsion,
suspension from degrees, and refusal of leave to
graduate until after a specified time, were normal
punishments for serious offences, for trivial misconduct
fines are now constantly prescribed, and
physical punishments for non-adults are also directed
in many cases.</p>

<p>In colleges, the Tudor statutes generally enjoined
good conduct on all students. The regulations
about the punishment of offences were mostly concerned
with grave matters for which admonitions,
and finally expulsions, were the recognized punishments.
Penalties for the non-performance of religious
exercises now appear: thus, at Christ’s
College, Cambridge, and at Balliol College, Oxford,
whipping was prescribed as a penalty for absence
from chapel, though probably restricted to the
younger students; so too at Peterhouse, students
over eighteen who were absent from prayers were
to be fined, while younger students so offending
were to be deprived of dinner, and if persistent in
their neglect flogged in hall.</p>

<p>As in medieval times, the authorities were generally
left a free hand in settling the regulations for
the maintenance of normal discipline. Probably
<a name="png.213" id="png.213" href="#png.213"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>205<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fines, impositions, restrictions on the food supplied,
and gatings continued to be ordinarily used. Reading
the bible aloud at meal times in hall, dining apart on
bread and water, and being deprived of commons,
are definitely mentioned in the 1520 statutes of St
John’s College, Cambridge, as possible penalties;
similarly at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, being
compelled to eat alone at a small table in the middle
of the hall and restriction to bread and water are
specified as suitable punishments.</p>

<p>The use of the birch was now constantly prescribed,
though probably in practice always confined
to lads. Thus, at Christ’s College, Cambridge, a
whipping for lads and a fine for adults; and at
Brasenose, Oxford, a fine or a flogging, at the discretion
of the principal, were statutable punishments
for various faults, including at the latter College the
making of odious comparisons in conversation. At
other Houses too, for instance, at Corpus Christi,
Oxford, Wolsey (Christ Church), Oxford, Trinity
College, Cambridge, and Gonville and Caius, Cambridge,
the use of the cane or birch is sanctioned
in the case of lads. I have no doubt this was also
the general rule in earlier days, and nothing in
the Tudor codes indicates that any material change
was made in the existing practice, but on the whole
I conjecture that the regulations were more humane,
and I am inclined to think, contrary to Rashdall’s
<a name="png.214" id="png.214" href="#png.214"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>206<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>view, that discipline was less severe after the renaissance
than before it. In colleges the deans were
and are the chief officers responsible for discipline;
in the University, the proctors.</p>

<p>A part of the fifth chapter of the Trinity statutes
of 1560 relating to the office of deans may be summarized
as indicating what was then customary, or at
any rate desired, in the matter of chapel attendance
and in certain questions of petty discipline. The
statute, which is in Latin, is to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In every community regard should be paid to correctness
of morals and general probity of life, accordingly there
shall be two deans to give their sedulous attention to these
objects; at least one of such deans shall be a bachelor of
divinity and chosen from the eight senior fellows, and the
other, a master of arts or a bachelor of divinity.</p>

<p>The deans shall provide for the fitting performance of
public worship; see that all fellows, scholars, pensioners,
sizars, and subsizars attend on Saints’ days and Sundays at
morning and evening prayers, the litany, the communion,
and sermons; and see that the same persons are on other
days regularly present at prayers between five and six o’clock
in the morning. Every fellow who is absent shall be fined
three half-pence, and if he comes in late or goes out early,
one half-penny. The fine for a bachelor scholar who is absent
shall be one penny, and for one who comes in late or goes
out early, one half-penny. Every undergraduate scholar,
and every pensioner, sizar, and subsizar who is absent shall,
if his age exceeds eighteen years be fined one half-penny,
and if he comes in late or goes out early, one farthing; but
if such student has not attained this age, he shall be chastised
<a name="png.215" id="png.215" href="#png.215"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>207<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with rods in the hall on the following Friday. Those
are to be deemed as coming late who at evening prayers
arrive after the first psalm; at morning prayers, after the
<cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Venite</cite>; at the Litany, after the words <i>O Holy Blessed and
Glorious Trinity</i>; and at the communion service after the
recital of the commandments: anyone who, during service,
remains in the antechapel is to be punished as if he had
been absent.</p>

<p>Each week on Friday, at seven o’clock in the evening,
the deans shall chastise non-adult offenders. All scholars
(bachelors excepted), pensioners, sizars, and subsizars shall
be present during the infliction of such corporal punishment,
and anyone who does not answer to his name when called,
and does not stay until all the punishments are finished,
shall, if an adult, be fined one penny, and if non-adult be
flogged on the next day.</p>

<p>Each week on Thursday, the deans shall appoint two
monitors from among the bachelor scholars for noting
offences of bachelors; and six monitors [from among the
undergraduate scholars], two for noting offences of undergraduates
at public worship, and four for noting those who
fail to speak Latin: the monitors shall prepare lists of all
who offend in these particulars. The deans shall also appoint
each week six scholars and four sizars for service at the
fellows’ table, and one sizar for the organ.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the decorous celebration of public
worship, the deans shall bring with them to the first vespers
of every festival a written schedule of the duties of everyone
concerned in that festival, and shall further appoint an inquisitor
who shall remind everyone of the duty so assigned
to him. Anyone who shall fail in such duty shall, if a non-adult,
be whipt, and, if an adult, be fined fourpence.</p>

<p>One half of all fines inflicted shall go to the College, the
other half shall be kept by the deans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="png.216" id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>208<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The Tudor statutes generally remained in force
till the middle of the nineteenth century, though in
time the practices of the colleges came to differ
materially from what was there directed. Briefly we
may say that in the sixteenth century the standard of
medieval discipline and study sank; but in the early
years of the seventeenth century things improved
until the civil disturbances threw academic work
into confusion. With the establishment of the
commonwealth the age of entry rose, and thus the
use of corporal and puerile punishments died out,
and with the disappearance of boys as members of
the University, rules intended only for young lads
became obsolete and inoperative. Most of the students
henceforth were adolescent. The few who
were younger were dealt with like school-boys, but
the comparison is rather with school-boys of recent
years than with those of their own period.</p>

<p>As far back as Sir Simon D’Ewes’s time—and
he entered Cambridge in 1618—the majority of the
students were regarded as responsible, and capable
of conducting themselves rationally. They reflected
the virtues and foibles of their time, but they were a
select class, and compare favourably in manners and
morals with their contemporaries elsewhere. Almost
without exception they speak warmly of their
development in college from lads to young men, of
friendships formed with their elders as well as their
<a name="png.217" id="png.217" href="#png.217"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>209<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>contemporaries, of the abiding influence of the place,
and of their affection for it.</p>

<p>From the restoration to the regency was a
period of stagnation. Discipline deteriorated, and
if we may trust contemporary accounts drunkenness
and immorality were far from uncommon. No
doubt there were always some residents who maintained
high traditions and ideals, but on the whole
the records of the social life prevalent then at Cambridge
and Oxford make but sorry reading.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century codes indicate lofty aims,
but statutes and rules are not always observed
literally, and it may be thought that those mentioned
represented only old customs, perhaps already
obsolete, or what was deemed desirable but was not
enforced. It may be well then to turn to contemporary
evidence, to regulations passed on specific
occasions, and to records of definite punishments—though
we can expect the latter to have been
preserved only in grave cases, and cannot hope
to learn from them much about discipline in petty
matters.</p>

<p>Contemporary evidence would serve us best if we
could get it, but the diarists and letter-writers are
mostly silent on the subject. From this, however,
I conclude that generally the disciplinary regulations
were thought sensible. Life in the University
may have been hard and probably was so, but I do
<a name="png.218" id="png.218" href="#png.218"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>210<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not believe that discipline was unreasonable. All
the evidence is to the contrary. Thus the above-mentioned
Tusser, a student of no special brilliancy,
who entered at Trinity Hall in the early half of the
sixteenth century speaks thankfully of leaving
school, and says: “To Cambridge thence ... I got at
last, There joy I felt, there trim I dwelt, There
heaven from hell, I shifted well, With learned men,
a number then, the time I passed.”</p>

<p>Coming now to definite punishments, I mention
successively corporal punishments, such as birching,
the use of the stocks, and stanging; fines, direct and
indirect; deprivation of days or standing; gatings;
impositions; declaratory confessions; and rustications
and expulsions.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Birching, Flogging"><i>Birching, Flogging.</i></h3>
<p>Birching remained a recognized
punishment for the younger students in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but I think
that in practice it was not often inflicted except on
boys. One or two examples of orders directing it
will suffice.</p>
</div>

<p>On 8 May 1572, the Vice-Chancellor, Whitgift,
issued an order which is so detailed that I write
it at length. Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If any scholar shall go into any river, pool, or other
water in the county of Cambridge; by day or night, to swim
or wash, he shall, if under the degree of bachelor of arts,
for the first offence be sharply and severely whipped publicly
<a name="png.219" id="png.219" href="#png.219"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the common hall of the College in which he dwells, in the
presence of all the fellows, scholars, and others dwelling in the
College, and on the next day shall be again openly whipped
in the public school, where he was or ought to be an auditor,
before all the auditors, by one of the proctors or some other
assigned by the Vice-Chancellor, and for the second offence
every such delinquent shall be expelled his College and the
University for ever. But if he shall be a bachelor of arts,
then for the first offence he shall be put in the stocks for a
whole day, in the common hall of his College, and shall,
before he is liberated, pay 10s towards the commons of the
College, and for the second offence shall be expelled his
College and the University. And if he shall be a master of
arts, or bachelor of law, physic or music, or of superior
degree, he shall be severely punished, at the judgment and
discretion of the Master of his College.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">From this it is clear that at that time undergraduates,
even of mature age, were liable to be flogged as a
part of the ordinary discipline of the University and
College, but probably it was unusual to inflict the
penalty.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, after the disturbances of
20 February 1607, following the performance of a
comedy in King’s College, an order was issued that
thereafter every ringleader in any similar disturbances
should be banished from the University: and
every less responsible offender should, if a graduate,
pay for the harm done, be suspended from his
degree, and for one year refused leave to take a
further degree; and if a non-graduate should for
<a name="png.220" id="png.220" href="#png.220"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>one year be refused leave to graduate, and further,
if non-adult, be corrected in the schools by the
rod, and, if adult, make an open confession of his
guilt in the schools: also the offender if not a
scholar should be set in the stocks at the bull ring
in the market place. Here, it will be noticed, the
punishment by the rod is restricted to those non-adulti.</p>

<p>In a list of punishments inflicted at Corpus
Christi College in 1622, quoted by Lamb, admonitions,
fines, suspensions, and whippings are mentioned.
Even as late as 1648 there is a record of
“Benton per Tutorem suum Magistrum Johnson
virgis castigandis.”</p>

<p>In 1648 an undergraduate bible-clerk of Peterhouse,
age about seventeen, Tobias Conyers by
name was “corrected publicly”—which, I take it,
means flogged—for toasting the king. But times
were abnormal, and if Conyers ventured into the
stirring field of politics, he had to take the consequences.</p>

<p>The liability to a flogging still existed after the
restoration. Thus in the <cite>Poor Scholar</cite>, by R. Nevile,
London, 1662, there are references to it in
Act ii, Scene 6, and Act v, Scene 4, as being still
in use in colleges though whether adults were so
liable is uncertain. If the author’s statements refer
to contemporary matters and are trustworthy it
<a name="png.221" id="png.221" href="#png.221"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>would seem that the punishment was then common,
the culprits being mounted on barrels, and the
flogging inflicted at the butteries. The birch was
also still occasionally used in university discipline,
for on 20 March 1674, the vice-chancellor ordered
Ellethorpe of St John’s, and Hodges of Sidney
Sussex to be whipped for having been rude to the
junior proctor, Peter Parham, of Caius College:
neither of the offenders had matriculated.</p>

<p>These references provide the strongest evidence
with which I am acquainted for the assertions that
flogging was a usual punishment at Cambridge
during the seventeenth century. There is a widely
spread tradition that when at Christ’s College, Milton
was flogged, but Peile has shown that there is no
satisfactory evidence for it, and it is intrinsically
improbable. In a disciplinary order of Corpus
Christi College in 1684, the only punishments mentioned
are discommonsings, admonitions, rustications,
deprivation of seniority, and refusal of college
testimonials, so, comparing this with the orders of
1622 and 1648 which I have quoted above, perhaps
we may take it that the use of the rod there had
become obsolete.</p>

<p>The above extracts are sufficient to show that
corporal punishment was recognized under the Elizabethan
codes, though it seems probable that public
opinion was against its use, unless the students
<a name="png.222" id="png.222" href="#png.222"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were quite young; perhaps this was always the
practice, and thus, as the age of entry rose, the
use of the birch died out. Incepting bachelors and
senior students were usually punished for serious
offences by deferring their admission to degrees,
loss of terms, or rustication: being adult, they
were in effect regarded as not subject to corporal
punishment.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Stocks; Stangs"><i>Stocks. Stangs.</i></h3>
<p>A couple of other physical
punishments—ignominious and sometimes painful—may
be mentioned in passing.</p>
</div>

<p>One of these was confinement in Stocks. To this
allusion has already been made in the orders of 1572
and 1607. Another instance is to be found in the
records of Corpus Christi College, where about 1580,
one of the students, Tobias Bland, who had libelled
the master, was compelled to confess his fault publicly,
next put in the stocks, and then expelled. In
the old dining hall of Trinity College there were
stocks in the minstrel’s gallery, but there is no evidence
that they were re-erected when the hall was
rebuilt in 1605; perhaps the punishment was then
becoming unusual, though against this may be set
the fact that there are references to the college
stocks in 1610 at King’s, in 1625 at Christ’s, and
in 1642 at Emmanuel. The stocks at King’s and
Emmanuel, like those at Trinity, were in the hall.
Allusions to their use are rare. The punishment
<a name="png.223" id="png.223" href="#png.223"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>continued to be inflicted after the restoration, for
on 10 April 1680, Thomas Grigson, who had been
rude to the junior proctor, Thomas Verdon of
St John’s College, was ordered to be “sett fast in
the stocks, by the heeles for one whole houre, which
was presently effected by the Constable of Saint
Bennett’s Parish in Cambridge.” He had partially
atoned for his offence by begging pardon on his
knees, and so escaped a worse punishment.</p>

<p>The Stang was a wooden pole on which the luckless
culprit was tied, and carried ignominiously
through the courts of his college. In John Ray’s
<cite>Collection of English Words not Generally Used</cite>,
London, 1674, it is said that the “word is still used
in some colleges in the University of Cambridge; to
stang scholars in Christmas, being to cause them to
ride on a colt-staff or pole for missing of chappel.”
References to the place where the pole was kept
occur in the account-books of Trinity, St John’s,
Queens’, and Christ’s. In Parne’s unpublished
manuscript history of Trinity College, allusion is
made to stanging as though at the beginning of the
eighteenth century it had become recently obsolete.
From his language it would seem also that undergraduates
themselves inflicted the punishment on
those of their members who declined to take part in
the Christmas revelries.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Fines"><i>Fines.</i></h3>
<p>Pecuniary fines have been used to
<a name="png.224" id="png.224" href="#png.224"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>216<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>enforce discipline from the earliest times by the
University as well as by the colleges: after the
renaissance, the increasing age and means of students
made fines a suitable penalty for many of the less
serious offences, such as participation in forbidden
amusements, visits to places out of bounds, walking
across the grass in college courts, smoking in public
places, the failure to wear academic dress when required,
non-attendance at lectures, chapel, hall, etc.
Probably grave misconduct was punished otherwise,
or by fines combined with additional penalties.
A fine, if heavy, presses unequally on men of
different means; and thus a system of fines on a
fixed scale cannot be regarded as equitable. Fines
are still used as penalties for the infraction of
rules.</p>
</div>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Discommonsing; Dissizaring"><i>Discommonsing. Dissizaring.</i></h3>
<p>To be put out of
commons was a well-recognized penalty, applicable
chiefly to scholars and sizars, part of whose emolument
consisted of a right to dine in hall and, in
some cases, to have commons (bread, butter, and
beer) to a limited amount each day. To deprive
such a student of the right to dine in hall or of his
commons was equivalent to a pecuniary fine, and in
the case of a poor scholar might be a severe, though
not a satisfactory, punishment; probably a modicum
of bread and beer was supplied to students even
when discommonsed. In some comments, published
<a name="png.225" id="png.225" href="#png.225"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>217<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in 1768, on university education at Cambridge,
discommonsing is described as “one of the most
idle and anile punishments ... inflicted rather on
the parent than on the young man, who being
prohibited to eat in Hall is driven to purchase
a dinner at a tavern or coffee house.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here is an example of an order of discommonsing
at Trinity in the seventeenth century: “Agreed that
Cassill should be punisht a monthes <span class="nw">commons....</span>
Agreed at the same time that Pepys besides a
monthes commons, should have an admonition
and pay the charges of the chirurgion for the
healinge Cassil’s head w<sup>h</sup> he broke with a key.”
(Conclusion, 1 August 1643.) Its preservation is due
to the fact that Pepys’ punishment was combined
with an admonition, and evidence that an admonition
had been given might be required if subsequently
a question of expulsion arose. The culprit in question
was Thomas Pepys (B.A. 1645) and not the
Samuel of immortal memory.</p>

<p>In 1815, Mansel, master of Trinity and bishop of
Bristol, was accustomed to put men out of sizings
and commons if they appeared in hall in trousers
instead of knee breeches, and it would seem then
that to be put out of sizings further deprived the
student of obtaining private supplies from the
college kitchens. Half a century ago the penalty
was still in use at Trinity, being imposed on
<a name="png.226" id="png.226" href="#png.226"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>scholars in waiting, who failed to appear after hall
to say grace.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Loss of Days"><i>Loss of Days.</i></h3>
<p>To qualify for a degree and for an
emolument, it is and has been generally necessary to
keep a certain number of days by residence in each
of certain specified terms. At one time a common
form of punishment was to cancel a certain number
of days already kept. Thus the student would be
obliged to stay at Cambridge for so many additional
days to make up for the requisite number which had
to be kept in the course of that term. In the seventeenth
century the authorities went further and
sometimes cancelled terms that had been kept.
I believe this form of punishment has long been
obsolete.</p>
</div>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Gating; Walling"><i>Gating. Walling.</i></h3>
<p>Continuous confinement within
the walls of the college (walling) or confinement
during certain hours (gating) was another form of
punishment. A case of walling occurred at one of
the smaller colleges in Cambridge in 1872, but I
know of no more recent instance. Gating is still in
force. It causes some social inconvenience. As far
as it goes, it promotes regular hours and economy,
and it has no indirect ill-effects. Accordingly it
serves well to mark dissatisfaction and act as a
warning.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is an old-time example from the records of
Trinity, 19 July 1652, of the infliction of this and
<a name="png.227" id="png.227" href="#png.227"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>other penalties interesting from the name of the
scholar on whom it was inflicted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed that Dryden be put out of commons for a fortnight
at least, and that he goe not out of the colledg during
the time aforesaid, excepting to sermons, without express
leave of the master or vice-master; and that at the end of
the fortnight he read a confession of his crime, in the hall,
at the dinner time; at the three fellowes tables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">His offence was disobedience to the vice-master, and
his contumacy in submitting himself to discipline.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Impositions"><i>Impositions.</i></h3>
<p>Another tolerably obvious punishment
was the setting of impositions. The imposition
might be the learning of lines by heart or the
delivery of a declamation on some given subject,
or the production in writing of so many lines of a
classical work or of an analysis of some book. Impositions
in writing were constantly done vicariously,
and if so, the punishment was little more than a
fine: apparently this abuse of the practice was well
known.</p>
</div>

<p>The tasks set were very heavy. In the <cite>Gradus</cite>,
1803, the learning by heart of the first book of the
<cite>Iliad</cite> is mentioned as a possible, though very severe
imposition. Similarly, according to J. M. F. Wright,
a thousand lines of Homer would have been regarded
in 1815 as an unusually sharp punishment, but such
as might have been given in lieu of rustication.
Other impositions mentioned are the learning by
<a name="png.228" id="png.228" href="#png.228"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>220<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>heart of a satire of Juvenal, and the production of
an analysis of Butler’s <cite>Analogy</cite>.</p>

<p>At Trinity the deans were provided with long
sheets of paper on which were printed in double
columns forms such as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... to transcribe ... lines of Virgil’s Aeneid, beginning at
line ... book ..., and to deliver it to the Junior Dean after
morning Chapel on Tuesday.</p>

<p>... to transcribe ... lines of Homer’s Iliad, beginning at
line ... book ..., and to deliver it to the Senior Dean after
Morning Chapel on Thursday.</p>

<p>... to repeat ... lines of ... by order of the Junior (or
Senior) Dean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">These were filled up by the deans, cut off, and distributed
by the chapel-clerk to the men concerned.
Customarily in Trinity the senior dean gave impositions
from the <cite>Iliad</cite> to be delivered on a Thursday,
an the junior dean from the <cite>Aeneid</cite> to be
delivered on a Tuesday. Forms for putting men out
of commons, and admonishing them were printed in
the same way on sheets, to be used as occasions
arose.</p>

<p>Impositions were set at Trinity as late as 1830,
but I believe the custom had died out before 1840,
though I am told it was still used in certain Cambridge
colleges as late as 1855. At Oxford the practice
continued rather later and indeed at a few
colleges seems to have been in force till near the
close of the nineteenth century, for Rashdall, writing
<a name="png.229" id="png.229" href="#png.229"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in 1895, speaks of the practice as having been in
force there until recently.</p>

<p>A century ago there seems to have been a sort of
recognized scale of penalties for cutting lectures or
chapel. First, a reprimand was given at an interview
or sent in writing by a servant; second, an
imposition was set; third the offender was deprived
of commons and sizings. If these steps were ineffective,
the matter might be regarded as a serious
offence against college discipline, and lead to “hauling”
by the tutor, a gating, an interview with the
master, a formal admonition, and in extreme cases
to rustication.</p>

<p>The theory of these petty punishments was
set out by Whewell in his <cite>Principles of English
University Education</cite>, 1837. A punishment, according
to him, was to be regarded as the visible
expression of college dissatisfaction with certain
conduct: as an infliction it might be slight, but it
emphasized the discontent expressed, and acted as
a definite warning. He suggested a most severe
scale; namely, for the first offence, forfeiture of
one month’s commons; for the second, of three
months’ commons; and for the third, expulsion;
but there is no reason to think that this was ever
the practice.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Confessions"><i>Confessions.</i></h3>
<p>A public confession was another
form of punishment once used: I believe that
<a name="png.230" id="png.230" href="#png.230"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>this ceased to be employed by the middle of the
eighteenth century.</p>
</div>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Statutory Admonitions; Rustication; Expulsion"><i>Statutory Admonitions. Rustication. Expulsion.</i></h3>
<p>For the graver offences, a statutory admonition,
rustication (temporary removal from the college),
or expulsion were reserved.</p>
</div>

<p>A formal admonition was intended to act as a
serious warning, and it served as a statutory prelude
to expulsion. For this reason it was usually recorded,
and in former times an additional sting was
added by compelling the culprit to make also a
public or written confession of his fault. Admonitions
are not very common in the records of Trinity:
some thirty or forty occur in the sixteenth and
seventeenth century, only a few in the eighteenth
century, and they are rare in the nineteenth century
save for a few relating to irregularity of attendances
at chapel or lectures. The last admonition at Trinity
was given in 1881, shortly before the new statutes
of 1882 became operative. Here are typical instances
of the record of admonitions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas heretofore I have received an admonition from
the Master of the College for my lewd and outrageous behaviour
within the same, and have since that time for like
rioting and swaggering in the Town received another admonition
from him before the Vice-Master of the College
and my Tutor and also therewith all public correction, if
these admonitions together with due punishment do not
work reformation in me hereafter, I do likewise willingly
<a name="png.231" id="png.231" href="#png.231"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>acknowledge that I am incorrigible and worthy for the next
like offence to be expelled the College. Galen Browne.
Circ. 1601. [Browne was elected to a scholarship in 1602,
and graduated B.A. and M.A. in due course, so presumably
he amended his ways.]</p>

<p>Whereas I have very unadvisedly and rashly stricken one
Mr Halfhead, a College servant, to the shedding of blood,
I do acknowledge myself to have received an admonition
for that fault tending to expulsion. Thomas Shirley,
22 February, 1621. [Halfhead was the manciple. Shirley
was a fellow and master of arts, so the offence was the more
serious, but perhaps the provocation was great. Shirley
was subsequently junior bursar and tutor.]</p>

<p>I, Christopher Offley, do confess that often time and
many ways I have offended against the Statute <cite xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">de Modestia
Morum</cite> to the displeasure of God, hurt to myself, the evil
example of others, and discredit of the College, and also
have broken mine oath taken when I was preferred scholar
in unreverent behaviour towards some of the fellows and
specially in giving scandalous and contumelious speeches to
Mr Hitch, being the Minister and Fellow of this College for
which misdemeanors and undutiful carriage I am unfainedly
sorry and heartily desire forgiveness both of God, and him,
or any other whom I have offended, and confess I have
received a just admonition of the Master and Seniors by
setting my date to this writing. Circ. 1622. [Offley graduated
B.A., 1624, and M.A., 1627, so presumably he amended
his ways.]</p>

<p>Whereas we whose names are underwritten, on the fourth
of April last, were guilty of grave irregularity and misbehaviour
by insulting the Vice-Master, the Dean, and other
officers of the College and thereby gave just offence to the
Society, we do profess ourselves heartily sorry for the same
and acknowledge the lenity of the Master and Dean in
<a name="png.232" id="png.232" href="#png.232"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>suffering us to return so soon from rustication. And we do
hereby engage to be strictly observant of our duty for the
future and take this as our first admonition in order to
expulsion. James Bensley, John Ambler. 29 May, 1754.
[Bensley graduated in due course and was elected to a fellowship:
Ambler did not graduate.]</p>

<p>Ordered that ..., for irregular attendance at lectures
and neglect of impositions, be admonished a second time
previous to rustication or expulsion. 29 May, 1844.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Temporary or permanent removal from the
College were penalties reserved for the gravest
offences. They are still recognized as possible
punishments. The fact that there are but few
records of the infliction of these extreme penalties
indicates how easily discipline has always been
maintained.</p>

<p>My readers may well think that the results of
these notes are somewhat scanty, but if that nation
is happy which has no history, surely universities
and colleges are to be congratulated whose records
of punishment are so few. To sum up the matter,
the general effect left on my mind is that most of
the common offences were due only to youthful
exuberance of spirits and not to deliberate mischief
making; and that the rules and sanctions, judged
by the standard of their time, have been neither
harsh nor unreasonable, and have usually been
approved by public opinion in the University.</p>

 /><small>NEWTON’S <cite>PRINCIPIA</cite>.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">Newton’s</span> <cite>Principia</cite> is one of the few scientific
books which has sensibly affected the methods
of scientific research and the ideas of men about the
universe. It is on this aspect of the subject I propose,
in this paper, to make a few remarks. The
work itself is a classic in the history of mathematics:
the exposition of the subject, the enunciation of the
principle of prime and ultimate ratios, the creation
of mechanics as a science resting on experiments,
and the theory of universal gravitation with concrete
applications to the solar system, make it a
masterpiece. Here I avoid all technicalities, and
confine myself to a general description of its genesis
and contents and the reason why its publication
affected scientific thought and methods.</p>

<p>Newton’s exposition arose from an investigation
of the cause of the motion of the planets round the
sun, and this in due course led to the enunciation
and establishment of the Newtonian theory of attraction.
The origin of this theory has been often told,
but will bear repetition. The fundamental idea
occurred to Newton in 1665 or 1666, shortly after
he had taken his degree at Cambridge, when, as he
<a name="png.234" id="png.234" href="#png.234"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wrote later, “I was in the prime, of my age for invention,
and minded Mathematicks and Philosophy
more than at any time since.” His reasoning was
as follows. He knew that gravity extended to the
highest hills, he saw no reason why it should cease
to act at greater heights, accordingly he believed
that it would be found in operation as far as the
moon, and he suspected that it might be the force
which retained that body in its path round the earth.</p>

<p>This hypothesis he verified thus. If a stone is
allowed to fall near the surface of the earth, the
attraction of the earth causes it to move through
sixteen feet in one second: also Kepler’s Laws, if
accurate and applicable, involve the conclusion that
the attraction of the earth on a distant body varies
inversely as the square of its distance from the
earth. Now the radius of the earth and the
distance of the moon were known to Newton, and
therefore, on this hypothesis, he could find the
magnitude of the earth’s attraction on the moon.
Further, assuming that the moon moved in a circle,
he could calculate the force required to retain it in
its orbit. At this time his estimate of the radius of
the earth was inaccurate, and, when he made the
calculation, he found that this force was rather
greater than the earth’s attraction on the moon.
The discrepancy did not shake his faith in his theory,
but he conjectured that the moon’s motion was also
<a name="png.235" id="png.235" href="#png.235"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>affected by other influences, such for example, as
the effect of a resisting medium which might itself
be in motion as supposed by Descartes in his hypothetical
vortices.</p>

<p>In 1679 Newton knew with approximate correctness
the value of the radius of the earth. He repeated
his calculations, and found the results to be
in accordance with his former hypothesis. He then
proceeded to the general theory of the motion of a
particle under a force directed to a fixed point, and
showed that the vector to the particle would sweep
over equal areas in equal times. He also proved
that, if a particle describes an ellipse under a force
directed to a focus, the law must be that of the inverse
square of the distance from the focus, and conversely,
that the orbit of a particle projected in free
space under the influence of such a force must be a
conic. The application to the solar system was
obvious, since Kepler had shown that the planets
describe ellipses with the sun in one focus, and that
the vectors from the sun to them sweep over equal
areas in equal times. This investigation was made
for his own satisfaction and was not published at the
time. In it he treated the solar bodies as if they
were particles, and he must have realized that the
results could be taken as being only approximately
correct.</p>

<p>In 1684 the subject of the planetary orbits was
<a name="png.236" id="png.236" href="#png.236"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>discussed in London by Halley, Hooke, and Wren.
They were aware that, if Kepler’s conclusions were
correct, the attraction of the sun or earth on a distant
external particle must vary inversely as the
square of the distance, but they could not determine
the orbit of a particle subjected to the action of a
central force of this kind. It was suggested that
Newton might be able to assist them. Accordingly
in August, Halley went to Cambridge for a talk on
the subject, and then found that Newton had solved
the problem some five years previously, and that the
path was necessarily a conic. At Halley’s request
Newton wrote out the substance of his argument,
and sent it to London.</p>

<p>Halley at once realized the importance of the
communication, and later in the autumn returned to
Cambridge to urge Newton to prosecute the theory
further. He found that Newton had already done
something in the matter, the results being contained
in a manuscript which he saw. Probably this reference
is to the holograph manuscript, still preserved
in the University Library at Cambridge, of Newton’s
lectures in the Michaelmas Term, which served as
the basis of his memoir sent to the Royal Society a
few months later. The great value of these investigations
was recognized, and Newton was persuaded
to attack the more general problem. His results
are given in the <cite>Principia</cite>.</p>

<p><a name="png.237" id="png.237" href="#png.237"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>As yet Newton had dealt with the problem as if
the sun and the planets might be regarded as heavy
masses concentrated at their centres. Clearly at
the best this was only an approximation, though
considering the enormous distances involved it was
not unreasonable. In January or February, 1685,
he considered the question of the attraction of bodies
of finite size, and found, to his surprise and gratification,
that a sphere or spherical shell attracts an
external particle as if condensed into a heavy mass
at its centre. Hence the results he had already
proved for the relative motion of particles were true
for the solar system, save for small errors due partly
to the fact that the bodies were not perfectly
spherical and partly to disturbances caused by the
planets attracting one another. It was no longer a
question of rough approximation: the problem was
reducible to mathematical analysis, subject to the
introduction of minute corrections, which, given the
necessary observations, could be calculated very
closely. This was a new discovery of first-rate
importance, and initiated the modern theory of
attractions.</p>

<p>The first book of the <cite>Principia</cite> was finished before
the summer of 1685. It deals with the motion
of particles or bodies in free space either in known
orbits or under the action of known forces. In
it the law of attraction is generalized into the
<a name="png.238" id="png.238" href="#png.238"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>statement that every particle of matter attracts
every other particle with a force which varies
directly as the product of their masses and inversely
as the square of the distance between them.
Thus gravitation was brought into the domain of
Science.</p>

<p>The second book was completed by the summer
of 1686. It treats of motion in a resisting medium
and of various problems connected with waves. At
the end of it, it is shown that the Cartesian theory of
vortices is inconsistent with the laws of motion, and
necessarily leads to incorrect results. This book
opened another world to the application of mathematics
and, in effect, created the science of hydrodynamics.</p>

<p>The third book was finished in March 1687. In
this, the theorems previously established are applied
to the chief phenomena of the universe, and briefly
we may say that all the facts then known about the
solar system and, in particular, the motion of the
moon with its various inequalities, the figure of the
earth, and the phenomena of the tides, were shown
to be in accord with the theory. Much of the
material for these calculations was collected by
Flamsteed and Halley.</p>

<p>The <cite>Principia</cite>, as I have said, is a classic. Like
other books to which that compliment is paid, it is
rarely read: indeed, I doubt whether there are a
<a name="png.239" id="png.239" href="#png.239"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dozen men in Cambridge who have glanced all
through it, even in a cursory manner. When I was
an undergraduate the course for the Tripos involved
five sections (1, 2, 3, 9, and 11) of the first book, but
now, probably with good reason, even this slight
acquaintance with the work is no longer required,
and to-day the character of these investigations is
unfamiliar to most mathematicians, while the fact
that it is written in Latin tends to diminish the
number of its readers. I will, then, with your permission,
describe briefly its frame-work.</p>

<p>First, however, let me remark on how different
was the knowledge of mathematics, even among
experts, at the time it was written from that current
to-day. In the geometry of the circle and conics
mathematicians were familiar with the methods of
Greek science, and in their application Newton was
unrivalled among his contemporaries, but outside
geometry methods of investigation were far to seek.
Analysis had been but little developed; algebraic
notation had only recently taken definite form;
trigonometry was still used mainly as an adjunct to
astronomy; analytical geometry had been invented
by Descartes, but no text-books on it of modern type
were available; while nothing about the calculus had
been published. Mechanics, however, had recently
been treated as a science—statics by Stevinus and
dynamics by Galileo—and this paved the way for
<a name="png.240" id="png.240" href="#png.240"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Newton’s investigations. In particular, Galileo had
established principles which foreshadowed the first
two laws of motion, and had deduced formulae in
linear motion like <span class="maths"><i>v</i>² = 2<i>fs</i>,</span>
<span class="maths"><i>s</i> = ½<i>ft</i>²,</span> and in circular
motion like <span class="maths"><i>f</i> = <i>v</i>² / <i>r</i>.</span></p>

<p>Newton prefaced the <cite>Principia</cite> by explaining
that the earliest problems in natural philosophy
which attract attention are connected with the phenomena
of motion, and it was with motion). that the
book dealt. To discuss motion effectively, it was
necessary to give precision to the language used,
and accordingly he propounded definitions of mass,
momentum, inertia, and so on, which have settled
the language of the subject. He next enunciated
his three well-known laws of motion, and described
the experiments on which he based them. He
followed this up by deducing rules for the composition
and resolution of forces, and discussed relative
motion.</p>

<p>This preliminary matter is followed by the first
book, concerned with the motion of bodies in an
unresisting medium. It is divided into fourteen
sections containing ninety-eight propositions with
various interpolated lemmas, corollaries, and scholia.</p>

<p>The first section is on the method of prime and
ultimate ratios, by the use of which Newton was
able, in effect, to integrate. He applied this to the
curvature and the areas of curves, and proved that,
<a name="png.241" id="png.241" href="#png.241"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the very beginning of the motion of a body from
rest under any force, the space described is proportional
to the force and the square of the time.</p>

<p>The second section is concerned with the motion
of a particle under a central force. It contains the
well-known propositions that if the force is central
the area swept out by the vector to the centre is proportional
to the time, and conversely that if such
area is proportional to the time the particle is
acted on by a central force. Newton further discussed
particular cases of circular, elliptic, and spiral
motion. In the third section he dealt with motion
in a conic under a central force to the focus, showed
that in this case the force must vary inversely as the
square of the distance, and conversely that if a particle
be projected from any point in any direction
with any velocity under such a force it must describe
a conic about the centre of force as a focus, and that
in such elliptic orbits the periodic times are in the
sesquiplicate ratio of the major axes of the ellipses.
He also explained how to treat the problem if disturbing
forces are introduced. These two sections
solved the problem of planetary motion if the planets
could be treated as particles and did not disturb one
another’s motions.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth sections are given up to the
proof of certain geometrical propositions in conics
required for subsequent discussions: in particular
<a name="png.242" id="png.242" href="#png.242"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the construction of a conic when a focus and three
other conditions or when five points on it or five
tangents to it are given.</p>

<p>In the sixth section Newton returned to the
problem of the motion of a particle in an ellipse
under a central force to a focus, and discussed how
to determine the position of the particle at any given
time. (Kepler’s Problem.)</p>

<p>The seventh and eighth sections are devoted to
the motion of a particle under a central force which
is any function of the distance. The geometrical
treatment of these problems is ingenious, but necessarily
more involved than when modern analysis is
used.</p>

<p>In the ninth section Newton dealt with the
motion of particles in orbits which are revolving
about the centre of force, and on the motion of the
apses of such orbits: this introduced the theory of
disturbing forces. The tenth section is concerned
with constrained motion, and particularly with the
motion of pendulums. The eleventh section deals
with the motion of particles under their mutual
attractions and incidentally with the problem of
three bodies. These three sections afford a notable
illustration of Newton’s analytical powers.</p>

<p>The twelfth and thirteenth sections deal with the
attraction under various laws of force of spherical
bodies, circular laminae, and solids of revolution.
<a name="png.243" id="png.243" href="#png.243"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>These sections brought the problem of the solar
system, consisting of solid bodies of finite size and
approximately spherical in form, into the domain
of mathematics, and led up to the generalization
that all particles of matter attract one another with
a force proportional to the product of their masses
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them, from which law it would seem
that all the known phenomena of the motions of the
solar system can be deduced.</p>

<p>The fourteenth section is concerned with the
motion of minute corpuscles, with applications to
the corpuscular theory of light.</p>

<p>The second book is devoted to the discussion of
the motion of bodies in resisting mediums: there are
fifty-three propositions besides lemmas, scholia, etc.</p>

<p>In the first section, Newton considered the
motion of a particle or sphere moving in a medium
whose resistance varies as the velocity of the particle:
in the second section the resistance is assumed
to vary as the square of the velocity: and in the third
section the resistance is supposed to consist of two
terms, one varying as the velocity and the other
as the square of the velocity. The fourth section
is on spiral motion caused by resistance of the
medium.</p>

<p>The fifth section deals with the density and pressure
of liquids and gases at rest (Hydrostatics).</p>

<p><a name="png.244" id="png.244" href="#png.244"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The sixth section treats of the motion of pendulums
in a resisting medium; and the seventh section
is concerned with the motion of fluids, and the resistance
they offer to the motion of projectiles. The
latter section contains the celebrated statement of
the form of the solid of least resistance, whose
demonstration proved a puzzle to mathematicians
until the invention of the calculus of variations.
Newton’s solution is in the Portsmouth papers, and
elsewhere I have published it: it involves the use of
fluxions, and it is probable that it was his failure to
translate this demonstration into geometrical language
that led him to give the result without a proof.</p>

<p>The eighth section deals with the motion of waves
with applications to the theory of sound and the undulatory
theory of light; and the ninth section deals
with vortices; it is here shown that the theory of vortices
suggested by Descartes to explain the motion
of the solar system is untenable.</p>

<p>This book created the theory of hydrodynamics.
Much of it is incomplete, but it is astonishing that
Newton proved as much as he did; of course to-day
no one would suggest that the best way of attacking
these problems is by Newtonian geometrical methods.</p>

<p>The third book contains the practical application
of the propositions in the two earlier books to the
solar system. I need not describe this in detail.
In order to justify this application, Newton commenced
<a name="png.245" id="png.245" href="#png.245"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by laying down four rules which have since
been accepted as binding in scientific investigations.
These, as given in the third edition, are to the
following effect: (1) We are not to assume more
causes than are sufficient and necessary for the
explanation of observed facts. (2) Hence, as far
as possible, similar effects must be assigned to the
same cause; for instance, the fall of stones in Europe
and America. (3) Properties common to all bodies
within reach of our experiments are to be assumed
as pertaining to all bodies; for instance, extension.
(4) Propositions in science obtained by a wide induction
are to be regarded as exactly or approximately
true, until phenomena or experiments show that they
may be corrected or are liable to exceptions. The
substance of these rules is now accepted as the basis
of scientific investigation. Their formal enunciation
here serves as a landmark in the history of thought.</p>

<p>As soon as the Copernican view of the solar
system was accepted, it was natural for men to seek
to explain the reason why the planets moved as they
did. Descartes, in 1644, had suggested that the
explanation might be found in the existence of vortices
in space. This conjecture, although based on
arbitrary assumptions, and in fact untenable, played
an important part in the history of the subject,
for it accustomed men to think that planetary
phenomena might be explicable by the same laws
<a name="png.246" id="png.246" href="#png.246"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as are found to be true on the earth. That this was
so was established by Newton in his <cite>Principia</cite>, where
all the motions of the solar system were made to depend
on one assumption as to the law of attraction.
The question whether this law could itself be deduced
from some more fundamental assumption was raised
by Newton, but he could not devise a satisfactory
hypothesis. It has been discussed again and again
since his time, and the problem is still unsolved.</p>

<p>Newton’s conclusions were immediately accepted
in Britain, and very rapidly by the leading mathematicians
in Europe: indeed Huygens came expressly
from Holland in order to make the personal
acquaintance of a writer whose work promised to
revolutionize the history of science. The refutation
of the Cartesian hypothesis ran, however, counter
to the sentiments and wishes of a certain number of
philosophers, and some few years elapsed before the
truth of the gravitation theory was universally admitted,
but it would be ungracious to dwell further
on this. In Britain the work exercised a profound
influence in philosophy as well as in science, and
educated men of all schools of thought acquainted
themselves with the general line of Newton’s reasoning
and his deductions.</p>

<p>That men of science and philosophers should
have approved Newton’s theory is not surprising,
but it is somewhat curious that it excited so little
<a name="png.247" id="png.247" href="#png.247"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>239<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>opposition among theologians. Galileo’s discoveries
of hills, vales, and (supposed) seas on the moon and
planets had already suggested that life might exist
there, and in the popular (but illogical) view this
involved the idea of the existence of beings with
spiritual and intellectual faculties not unlike those
of men. Newton’s results seemed to show that
there was nothing in the nature of things to differentiate
the earth from the other planets, and therefore
considerably strengthened the view that life
might be found on them. It might well be asked
whether such life, and indeed whether the mechanism
of the solar system as expounded by Newton,
was in accordance with Scripture. That these difficulties
were not pressed against Newton’s conclusions
is, I think, attributable to the fact that his
theory was explicitly concerned only with non-organic
matter. His own opinion was that the
extension of the reign of law was an additional
argument in favour of a divine creation: this view,
set out at the end of the <cite>Principia</cite> and in his
five letters to Bentley in 1692–93, was generally
accepted by the leaders of religious thought in
Britain.</p>

<p>Lagrange more than once remarked that Newton
was not only the greatest mathematician of former
days, but the most fortunate, since, as there is but
one universe, it can happen to but one man in the
<a name="png.248" id="png.248" href="#png.248"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>world’s history to be the interpreter of its laws. It
is true that Newton applied his theory only to the
solar system for which alone he had the necessary
data, but after the publication of the <cite>Principia</cite>, no
one doubted that gravity extended to the most distant
regions of space. The work of Sir William
Herschel and that of all later astronomers on binary
and other systems rests on this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The influence of the <cite>Principia</cite> on dynamical
astronomy has been permanent. It is not too
much to say that when it was published, the theory,
as there set out, had outstripped observation, but
during the succeeding century large numbers of new
facts were collected, and applications of the theory
to new problems were made, notably by Clairaut,
Euler, and Lagrange. All these researches tended
to confirm it.</p>

<p>The demonstrations in the <cite>Principia</cite> are expressed
in the language of classical geometry, and,
though unnecessarily concise and difficult, their
correctness is unimpeachable. That Newton could
carry his calculations so far with the limited mathematics
then at his command is not the least wonderful
part of the performance, but it is the prerogative of
genius to get great results with but scanty equipment.</p>

<p>Newton’s methods, which even in the seventeenth
century were archaic, became in time quite out of
<a name="png.249" id="png.249" href="#png.249"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>date. This reason, the growth of the subject, and
the development of analysis made it desirable to
expound dynamical astronomy afresh. Towards
the end of the eighteenth century the task was undertaken
by Laplace in his <cite xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">Mécanique Céleste</cite>. This
is far more than the translation of the <cite>Principia</cite>
into the language of modern analysis, for it greatly
extends the theory of some branches of the subject
which had been left incomplete by Newton, either on
account of his not having the requisite analysis at
his command or because the necessary facts were
not available. Laplace acknowledged his debt to
Newton, and expressed his deliberate opinion that
the <cite>Principia</cite> was pre-eminent over every previous
production of human genius—“so near the
gods, man cannot nearer go.” A century later a
fresh exposition of the subject embodying the discoveries
of the nineteenth century was given by
F. F. Tisserand in his <cite xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">Mécanique Céleste</cite>; this presents
the subject in its modern form.</p>

<p>Newton had applied his theory to the solar
system as it existed, and had not investigated its
origin. We owe to Laplace the enunciation of a
hypothesis as to its evolution. According to this
conjecture, the solar system originated in a quantity
of incandescent gas rotating round an axis through
its centre of mass. Laplace assumed that as this gas
cooled, it would contract, and that successive rings
<a name="png.250" id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>242<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>would break off from its outer edge; these rings in
their turn would cool, and finally condense into the
planets with their satellites; while the sun represents
the central core which would be left. Recent
investigations show that this cannot be taken as
correct without numerous modifications. Moreover
every extension of our knowledge requires the introduction
of alterations in the hypothesis, and this
clearly suggests that the conjecture is untenable.
It played, however, a useful part in its day, as
suggesting a common origin for all members of the
system. Perhaps I ought to add that a nebular
origin had been previously outlined by Kant, who
had also suggested meteoric aggregations and tidal
friction as agents concerned, but these were little
more than vague conjectures.</p>

<p>The <cite>Principia</cite> convinced its readers that the laws
of mechanics, discovered by experiment on the
earth, were operative throughout the solar system.
It was reserved for the nineteenth century to extend
the reign of law to other celestial phenomena.
Newton and his successors had proved that the law
of gravity extends through all parts of space where
observations are possible. That the sun, stars, and
planets are constituted of similar materials was
generally believed; and this has now been confirmed
by the use of the spectroscope which has enabled us
to calculate the temperature of gaseous stars, and
<a name="png.251" id="png.251" href="#png.251"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>243<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>specify the chemical elements comprised in them.
Thus the composition of far-distant suns has been
reduced to problems to be settled in our laboratories.
The scientific world, however, in admitting the validity
of the theory of universal gravity had implicitly
accepted the principle that the reign of law, as investigated
on the earth, extends throughout the
universe. Thus the daring which permits us, living
on a medium-sized planet attached to one of the
smaller suns, to analyse the universe is, I venture
to say, the direct outcome of the genius of Newton
as displayed in his <cite>Principia</cite>.</p>

<p>“Undergraduates to be instructed by a Tutor, a
Humanity Lecturer, a Greek Lecturer, a Philosophy
Lecturer, and a Mathematic Lecturer.</p>

<p>“The Tutor to read logic, ethics, the globes and
<a name="png.253" id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>principles of geography and chronology in order to
understand history, unless the Lecturers have time
for any of these things.</p>

<p>“The Humanity and Greek Lecturers to set
tasks in Latin and Greek authors once a day to the
first year, and once a week to the rest; and to examine
diligently and instruct briefly; and to punish
by exercises such faults as concern lectures; and to
appoint the reading of the best historians.</p>

<p>“The Philosophy Lecturer to read first of things
introductory to natural philosophy—time, space,
body, place, motion and its laws, force, mechanical
powers, gravity and its laws, hydrostatics, projectiles
solid and fluid, circular motions and the
forces relating to them. And then to read natural
philosophy, beginning with the general system of the
world, and thence proceeding to the particular constitution
of this earth and the things therein—meteors,
elements, minerals, vegetables, animals,
and ending with anatomy if he have skill therein.
Also to examine in logic and ethics.</p>

<p>“The Mathematic Lecturer to read first some
easy and useful practical things; then Euclid,
spherics, the projections of the sphere, the construction
of maps, trigonometry, astronomy, optics,
music, algebra, etc. Also to examine and (if the
Tutor be deficient) to instruct in the principles of
chronology and geography.</p>

<p><a name="png.254" id="png.254" href="#png.254"><span class="pagenum"><span

 /></span></span></a>“Several sciences which depend not on one another
are all learnt in less time together than successively,
the mind being diverted and recreated by the
variety, and put more upon the stretch. And therefore
divers of these Lecturers may proceed together:
suppose the Tutor’s [lectures] after morning chapel,
the Greek or Philosophy Lecturer’s two hours after,
and the Humanity and Mathematic [Lecturers’] in
the afternoon. The Tutor to accompany his pupils
to the philosophy and mathematic lectures, and to
examine them the next morning both in those lectures
and in his own, and make them understand where
they hesitate. These two Lecturers to read five
days in the week and with the other two [Lecturers]
to examine the sixth. Each Lecturer to read the
same day successively to two or three years [<i>i.e.</i>, to
Freshmen, Junior Sophs, or Senior Sophs as the
case may be] under [their] several Tutors. Their
lectures to begin with [the] Michaelmas Term and
continue till the Commencement [<i>i.e.</i> the end of the
Easter Term]: the Tutors to begin the Commencement
before. The Greek and Humanity Lecturers
to set bigger tasks in the vacations than in the
reading-time, proportionally to the spare hours of
the students.</p>

<p>“A Monitor to note those who miss lectures, and
give their names to the Humanity Lecturer, who
shall punish them, not by pecuniary mulcts, but by
<a name="png.255" id="png.255" href="#png.255"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>247<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>tasks [, such as] by making verses, themes, epistles, or
getting anything without book. All pecuniary mulcts
of Undergraduates to be abolished; and exercises,
admonitions, recantations, and expulsions (according
to the nature of the crime) to succeed in their room.</p>

<p>“In the Long Vacation, between the Commencement
and Michaelmas, the Tutor shall take care that
his Pupils read over all the last year’s lessons again
by themselves, and at the end of the vacation they
shall be examined again, and those, who are at any
time found not fit to go on, turned down to the
lectures of the year below, that they do not retard
the Lecturer and be an ill example to others.</p>

<p>“The Lecturers to be chosen every three years,
and the elections after the first institution to be on
this manner. All those who have at any time been
Lecturers shall choose four out of their number, one
for each office, and the Master and Seniors of the
College shall choose other four who have not yet
executed the office, and those eight with the Master
shall, by balancing, choose four out their number.
[There shall be] no regard to seniority or anything
but merit. The Lecturers to choose yearly a Public
Tutor, and to reprehend or displace him if there be
reason. This Tutor without a new election to take
none but those admitted in his year of office until
their course of lectures be gone through. No
Private Tutor to take two years together. All

 </span></span></a>sizars, poor scholars, and scholars of the House to
be under Public Tutors, except Westminster scholars
of Trinity College when the Tutor is of another school.</p>

<p>“For encouraging able and fit men to accept of
the Readers’ places, their fellowships during their
office shall be doubled by the addition of four other
fellowships kept vacant for the purpose, one, for
each, unless some other competent provision be
made for any of them. And because the Philosophy
and Mathematic Lecturers’ office is laborious, for
encouraging them to diligence none shall be compelled
to come to their lectures, but all that will be
auditors shall offer each of them a quarterly gratuity;
suppose of 10s. the sizar, 12s. or 15s. the pensioner,
and 20s. or 25s. the fellow-commoner. And to encourage
auditors those shall be preferred to scholarships
and fellowships which are best skilled in all
sciences, <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">caeteris paribus</i>, and shall have seniority of
those that come not to lectures. This institution
to begin in the greater colleges, and be carried on in
the rest as men qualified and revenues can be had.
In smaller colleges the Mathematic Lecturer may
be omitted, and only a power granted the College
of instituting one when they can. Also the Greek
Lecturer’s office may be supplied by the Humanity
Lecturer when it shall be thought fit. A gratuity
to be given by all the first year to the Greek and
Humanity Lecturers.</p>

desirable by fit persons, every student at his admission
to deposit caution money in the hands of the
bursar of the College; suppose <i>£</i>10 or <i>£</i>12 the sizar,
<i>£</i>16 or <i>£</i>20 the pensioner, and <i>£</i>30 or <i>£</i>40 the fellow-commoner.
And in case any pupil at the end of any
quarter be in his Tutor’s debt, and do not discharge it
within six weeks after his receipt of the quarter bill,
the Bursar to discharge it, and return back the
residue upon demand, and the Tutor forthwith upon
pain of forfeiting his office, to send home the pupil.
Yet may the pupil be received again with a new
supply of money. This institution to be universal.
The Master and Seniors to regulate the expenses of
all under tuition by certain limits common to them
all, and the Senior Dean to read over and sign all
their quarter bills. Extravagant pupils, after one
admonition, to be sent away.</p>

<p>“Fellow-commoners to perform all exercises in
their courses, and to be equally subject to their
Tutors and Governors with other scholars and alike
punishable by exercises, and those who are resty
or idle to be sent away lest they spoil others by their
bad example. They shall read geography, chronology,
and mathematics the first year.</p>

<p>“All students who will be admitted to lectures
in natural philosophy to learn first geometry and
mechanics. By mechanics I mean here the demonstrative
<a name="png.258" id="png.258" href="#png.258"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>doctrine of forces and motions, including
hydrostatics. For without a judgment in these
things a man can have none in philosophy.</p>

<p>“Whenever the major part of the Mathematic
Lecturers in the University shall desire [it] a Master
[shall be appointed] to teach fellow-commoners and
others arithmetic and designing. The University
shall allow him <i>£</i>10 yearly out of their Common
Chest, and he shall observe the orders of the Mathematic
Lecturers and be placed or displaced by the
major part of them at pleasure.</p>

<p>“All graduates without exception found by the
Proctors in taverns or other drinking houses, unless
with travellers at their inns, shall at least have their
names given in to the Vice-Chancellor, who shall
summon them to answer it before the next Consistory.</p>

<p>“The Deans to visit the chambers of all undergraduates
once at least every week, upon pain of
forfeiting 10s. to the Lecturers for every omission.</p>

<p>“Fasting nights have a shadow of religion without
any substance. ’Tis only supping more pleasantly
out of the public hall. And this does great
mischief by sending young students to find suppers
abroad, where they get into company and grow
debauched. Whether would it not be better to
license undergraduates to sup together in such
places as the Dean shall appoint, with a Monitor
to note the names of the absent?</p>

 /><small>THE HISTORY OF THE MATHEMATICAL TRIPOS.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allsc">The</span> Mathematical Tripos has played so prominent
a part in the history of education at
Cambridge and of mathematics in England, that a
sketch of its development<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn34" id="fna34" name="fna34">34</a></sup> may be interesting to
general readers.</p>

<p>So far as mathematics is concerned the history
of the University before Newton may be summed up
very briefly. The University was founded towards
the end of the twelfth century. Throughout the
middle ages, the instruction given to students was
organized on lines similar to those current at Paris
and Oxford, and to qualify for a degree it was
necessary to perform various exercises, and especially
to keep a number of <em>acts</em> or to oppose acts kept
by other students. An act consisted in effect of a
<a name="png.261" id="png.261" href="#png.261"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>253<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>debate in Latin, thrown, at any rate in later times,
into syllogistic form. It was commenced by one
student, the <em>respondent</em>, stating some proposition,
often propounded in the form of a thesis, which
was attacked by an <em>opponent</em> or <em>opponents</em>, the discussion
being controlled by a senior graduate. The
teaching was largely in the hands of young
graduates—every master of arts being compelled to reside and
teach for at least one year—though no doubt colleges
and private hostels supplemented this instruction in
the case of their own students.</p>

<p>The reformation in England was largely the
work of Cambridge divines, and in the University
the renaissance was warmly welcomed. In spite
of the disorder and confusion of the Tudor period,
new studies and a system of professional instruction
were introduced. The earliest lectureships created
by the University seem to have been one in Latin
established in or before 1492 and one in mathematics
established in or before 1501: they mark
the beginning of the system of teaching by experts
which has superseded the medieval system of compulsory
teaching by all regent masters. The fact
that one of these lectureships was in mathematics
shows that as early as 1500 the subject was regarded
as important. Tunstall, subsequently the
most eminent English arithmetician of his time,
migrated in 1496 from Oxford to Cambridge, and
<a name="png.262" id="png.262" href="#png.262"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>254<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>most of the subsequent English mathematicians
of the Tudor period were at Cambridge; of these
I may mention Record (who migrated, probably
about 1535, from Oxford), Dee, Digges, Blundeville,
Buckley, Billingsley, Hill, Bedwell, Hood, Richard
and John Harvey, Edward Wright, Briggs, and
Oughtred. Under the Elizabethan statutes of 1570,
notwithstanding many disadvantages, the mathematical
school continued to grow. Horrox, Seth
Ward, Foster, Rooke, Gilbert Clerke, Pell, Wallis,
Barrow, Dacres, and Morland may be cited as
prominent Cambridge mathematicians of the succeeding
century.</p>

<p>Newton’s mathematical career dates from 1665;
his reputation, abilities, and influence attracted
general attention to the subject. He created a
school of mathematics and mathematical physics,
among the earliest members of which I note the
names of Laughton, Samuel Clarke, Craig, Flamsteed,
Whiston, Saunderson, Jurin, Taylor, Cotes,
and Robert Smith. Since then Cambridge has been
regarded as, in a special sense, the home of English
mathematicians, and from 1706 onwards we have
fairly complete accounts of the course of reading and
work of mathematical students.</p>

<p>Until less than a century ago the form of the
method of qualifying for a degree remained substantially
unaltered, but the subject-matter of the
<a name="png.263" id="png.263" href="#png.263"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>255<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>discussions varied from time to time with the prevalent
studies of the place.</p>

<p>After the renaissance some of the statutable
exercises were “huddled,” that is, were reduced to
a mere form. To huddle an act, the proctor
generally asked some question such as <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Quid est
nomen?</i> to which the answer usually expected was
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Nescio</i>. In these exercises considerable license was
allowed, particularly if there were any play on the
words involved. For example, J. Brass, of Trinity,
was accosted with the question, <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Quid est aes?</i> to
which he answered, <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Nescio nisi finis examinationis</i>.
It should be added that retorts such as these
were only allowed in the pretence exercises, and
a candidate who in the actual examination was
asked to give a definition of happiness and replied,
“An exemption from Payne”—that being the name
of his questioner—was plucked for want of discrimination
in time and place. In earlier years
even the farce of huddling seems to have been
unnecessary, for it was said in 1675 that it was not
uncommon for the proctors to take “cautions for
the performance of the statutable exercises, and
accept the forfeit of the money so deposited in lieu
of their performance.”</p>

<p>In medieval times acts had been usually kept on
some scholastic question or on a proposition taken
from the <cite>Sentences</cite>. About the end of the fifteenth
<a name="png.264" id="png.264" href="#png.264"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>256<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>century religious questions, such as the interpretation
of biblical texts, began to be introduced. Some
fifty or sixty years later the favourite subjects were
drawn either from dogmatic theology or from philosophy.
In the seventeenth century the questions
were usually philosophical, but in the eighteenth
century, under the influence of the Newtonian school,
a large proportion of them were mathematical.</p>

<p>Further details about these exercises and specimens
of acts kept in the eighteenth century are
given in my <cite>History of Mathematics at Cambridge</cite>.
Here I will only say that they provided an admirable
training in the art of presenting an argument, and
in dialectical skill in attack and defence. The
mental strain involved in keeping a contested act
was severe. De Morgan, describing his act kept in
1826, wrote<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn35" id="fna35" name="fna35">35</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was badgered for two hours with arguments given and
answered in Latin—or what we call Latin—against Newton’s
first section, Lagrange’s derived functions, and Locke on
innate principles. And though I took off everything, and
was pronounced by the moderator to have disputed <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">magno
honore</i>, I never had such a strain of thought in my life. For
the inferior opponents were made as sharp as their betters
by their tutors, who kept lists of queer objections drawn
from all quarters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Had the language of the discussions been changed
to English, as was repeatedly urged from 1774
<a name="png.265" id="png.265" href="#png.265"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>257<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>onwards, these exercises might have been retained
with advantage, but the barbarous Latin and the
syllogistic form in which they were carried on prejudiced
their retention.</p>

<p>About 1830 a custom arose for the respondent
and opponents to meet previously and arrange their
arguments together. The discussions then became
an elaborate farce, and were a mere public performance
of what had been already rehearsed. Accordingly
the moderators of 1839 took the responsibility
of abandoning them. This action was
singularly high-handed, since a report of 30 May
1838, had recommended that they should be continued,
and there was no reason why they should
not have been reformed and retained as a useful
feature in the scheme of study.</p>

<p>On the result of the acts, a list of those qualified
to receive degrees was drawn up. This list was not
arranged strictly in order of merit, because the
proctors could insert names anywhere in it, but by
the beginning of the eighteenth century this power
had become restricted to the right reserved to the
vice-chancellor, the senior regent, and each proctor
to place in the list one candidate anywhere he liked—a
right which continued to exist till 1828, though
it was not exercised after 1792. Except for the
names of these “honorary optimes,” this final list
was, until 1752, arranged in order of merit into
<a name="png.266" id="png.266" href="#png.266"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>258<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wranglers and senior optimes, junior optimes, and
poll-men; after 1752, the wranglers and senior
optimes were placed in separate classes. The
bachelors on admission to their degrees took seniority
according to their order on this list. The title
<em>wrangler</em> is derived from these contentious discussions;
the title <em>optime</em> from the customary compliment
given by the moderator to a successful disputant,
<i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">Domine ..., optime disputasti</i>, or even <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">optime
quidem disputasti</i>, and the title of <em>poll-man</em> from the
description of this class as
<span title="[Greek: hoi polloi]" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">οἱ πολλοί</span>.</p>

<p>The final exercises for the bachelor of arts degree
were never huddled, and until 1839 were carried out
strictly. University officials were responsible for
approving the subject-matter of these acts. Stupid
men offered some irrefutable truism, but the ambitious
student courted reputation by affirming
some paradox. Probably all honour men kept acts,
but poll-men were deemed to comply with the regulations
by keeping opponencies. The proctors were
responsible for presiding at these acts, or seeing that
competent graduates did so. In and after 1649 two
examiners were specially appointed for this purpose.
In 1680<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn36" id="fna36" name="fna36">36</a></sup> these examiners were appointed by the
senate with the title of moderator, and with the
joint stipend of four shillings for everyone graduating
as a bachelor of arts during their year of office.
<a name="png.267" id="png.267" href="#png.267"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>In 1688 the joint stipend of the moderators was
fixed at <i>£</i>40 a year. The moderators, like the
proctors, were nominated by the colleges in rotation.</p>

<p>From the earliest times the proctors had the
power of questioning a candidate at the end of a
disputation, and probably all candidates for a
degree attended the public schools on certain days
to give an opportunity to the proctors (or any
master who liked to take part in the examination)
to examine them<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn37" id="fna37" name="fna37">37</a></sup>, though the opportunity was not
always used. Such examinations were conducted in
Latin, and originally different candidates attended
on different days. Soon after 1710<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn38" id="fna38" name="fna38">38</a></sup> the moderators
or proctors began the custom of summoning on one
day in January all candidates whom they proposed
to question, and conducting the examination in
English and in public: the examination did not
last more than one day, and was partly on philosophy
and partly on mathematics. It was from
this examination that the Mathematical Tripos
developed.</p>

<p>This introduction of a regular oral examination
seems to have been mainly due to the fact that
when, in 1710, George I gave the Ely library to the
<a name="png.268" id="png.268" href="#png.268"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>University, it was decided to assign for its reception
the old senate-house—now the catalogue room in the
library—and to build a new room for the meetings
of the senate. Pending the building of the new
senate-house the books were stored in the Schools,
which thus were rendered unavailable for keeping
acts. In consequence of this, considerable difficulty
was found in arranging for all the candidates to keep
the full number of statutable exercises, and obtaining
opportunities to compare them one with
another: hence the introduction or extension of a
supplementary oral examination. The advantages
of this examination as providing a ready means of
testing the knowledge and abilities of the candidates
were so patent that it was retained when the necessity
for some system of the kind had passed away, and
finally it became systematized into an organized test
to which all questionists were subjected.</p>

<p>In 1731 the University raised the joint stipend of
the moderators to <i>£</i>60 “in consideration of their
additional trouble in the Lent Term.” This would
seem to indicate that the senate-house examination
had then taken formal shape, and perhaps that a
definite scheme for its conduct had become customary.</p>

<p>As long as the order of the list of those approved
for degrees was settled on the result of impressions
derived from acts kept by the different candidates
<a name="png.269" id="png.269" href="#png.269"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at different times and on different subjects, it was
impossible to arrange the men in strict order of
merit, nor was much importance attached to the
order. But, with the introduction of an examination
of all the candidates on one day, much closer
attention was paid to securing an accurate classification,
and more confidence felt in the published order.
It seems to have been consequent on this that in and
after 1748 the final lists were regarded as authoritative
and important and that the names of the
honorary optimes were definitely indicated: the lists
from this time appeared in the <cite>University Calendars</cite>.
The lists from 1748 to 1910, with the earlier Ordines
Senioritatis from 1499 to 1747, are printed in the
<cite>Historical Register of the University</cite>.</p>

<p>Of the detailed history of the examination until
the middle of the eighteenth century we know
nothing. From 1750 onwards, however, we have
more definite accounts of it. At this time, it would
seem that all the men from each college were taken
together as a class, and questions passed down by
the proctors or moderators till they were answered:
but the examination remained entirely oral, and
technically was regarded as subsidiary to the discussions
which had been previously held in the schools.</p>

<p>Each class contained men of very different
abilities, and to meet difficulties thus caused, a
custom grew up by which every candidate was
<a name="png.270" id="png.270" href="#png.270"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>262<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>liable to be taken aside to be questioned by any
master of arts who wished to do so, and this was
regarded as an important part of the examination.
The examination now continued for two days and
a half, the subjects, as before, being mathematics
and philosophy. At the conclusion of the second
day the moderators received the reports of those
masters of arts who had voluntarily taken part in
the examination, and provisionally settled the final
list. The last half-day was used in revising and rearranging
the order of merit.</p>

<p>Richard Cumberland has left an account of the
tests to which he was subjected when he took his
bachelor degree in 1751. Clearly the disputations
still played an important part, and it is difficult to
say what weight was attached to the subsequent
senate-house examination; his reference to it is only
of a general character. After saying that he kept
two acts and two opponencies he continued<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn39" id="fna39" name="fna39">39</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last time I was called upon to keep an act in the
schools I sent in three questions to the Moderator, which
he withstood as being all mathematical, and required me
to conform to the usage of proposing one metaphysical
question in the place of that, which I should think fit to
withdraw. This was ground I never liked to take, and I
appealed against his requisition: the act was accordingly
put by till the matter of right should be ascertained by the
statutes of the university, and in the result of that enquiry
<a name="png.271" id="png.271" href="#png.271"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>263<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it was given for me, and my question <span class="nw">stood....</span> I yielded now
to advice, and paid attention to my health, till we were
cited to the senate house to be examined for our Bachelor’s
degree. It was hardly ever my lot during that examination
to enjoy any respite. I seemed an object singled out as
every man’s mark, and was kept perpetually at the table
under the process of question and answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was found possible by means of the new
examination to differentiate the better men more
accurately than before; and accordingly, in 1753,
as above stated, the first class was subdivided
into two, called respectively wranglers and senior
optimes, a division which is still maintained.</p>

<p>The semi-official examination by masters of arts
was regarded as the more important part of the
test, and the most eminent residents in the University
took part in it. Thus John Fenn, of Caius,
5th wrangler in 1761, wrote<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn40" id="fna40" name="fna40">40</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the following Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we
sat in the Senate-house for public examination; during this
time I was officially examined by the Proctors and Moderators,
and had the honour of being taken out for examination
by Mr Abbot, the celebrated mathematical tutor of St
John’s College, by the eminent professor of mathematics
Mr Waring, of Magdalene, and by Mr Jebb of Peterhouse,
a man thoroughly versed in the academical studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">This irregular examination by any master who chose
to take part in it constantly gave rise to accusations
of partiality.</p>

<p><a name="png.272" id="png.272" href="#png.272"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>In 1763 the traditional rules for the conduct of
the examination took more definite shape. Henceforth
the examiners used the disputations only as a
means of classifying the men roughly. On the result
of their “acts,” and probably partly also of their
general reputation, the candidates were divided into
eight classes, each arranged in alphabetical order.
The subsequent position of the men in the class was
determined solely by the senate-house examination.
The first two classes comprised all who were expected
to be wranglers, the next four classes included the
other candidates for honours, and the last two
classes consisted of poll-men only. Practically anyone
placed in either of the first two classes was
allowed, if he wished, to take an aegrotat senior
optime, and thus escape all further examination:
this was called gulphing it.</p>

<p>All the men from one college were no longer
taken together, but each class was examined separately
and <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">vivâ voce</i>; and hence, since all the students
comprised in each class were of about equal attainments,
it was possible to make the examination more
effective. Richard Watson, of Trinity, claimed that
this change was made by him when acting as
moderator in 1763. He said<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn41" id="fna41" name="fna41">41</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was more room for partiality ... then [<i>i.e.</i> in 1759]
<a name="png.273" id="png.273" href="#png.273"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>than there is now; and I attribute the change, in a great
degree, to an alteration which I introduced the first year
I was moderator [<i>i.e.</i> in 1763], and which has been persevered
in ever since. At the time of taking their Bachelor of Arts’
degree, the young men are examined in classes, and the
classes are now formed according to the abilities shown by
individuals in the schools. By this arrangement, persons
of nearly equal merits are examined in the presence of each
other, and flagrant acts of partiality cannot take place.
Before I made this alteration, they were examined in classes,
but the classes consisted of members of the same College,
and the best and worst were often examined together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">It is probable that before the examination in the
senate-house began a candidate, if manifestly placed
in too low a class, was allowed the privilege of
challenging the class to which he was assigned.
Perhaps this began as a matter of favour, and was
only granted in exceptional cases, but a few years
later it became a right which every candidate could
exercise; and I think that it is partly to its development
that the ultimate predominance of the tripos
over the other exercises for the degree is due.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1763, it was decided that the
relative position of the senior and second wranglers,
namely, Paley, of Christ’s, and Frere, of Caius, was
to be decided by the senate-house examination and
not by the disputations. Henceforward distinction
in that examination was regarded as the most important
honour open to undergraduates.</p>

<p>In 1768 Robert Smith, of Trinity College, founded
<a name="png.274" id="png.274" href="#png.274"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>prizes for mathematics and natural philosophy open
to two commencing bachelors. The examination
followed immediately after the senate-house examination,
and the distinction, being much coveted,
tended to emphasize the mathematical side of the
normal university education of the best men. Since
1883 the prizes have been awarded on the result of
dissertations<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn42" id="fna42" name="fna42">42</a></sup>. Additional prizes, awarded at the
same time, and associated with the name of Lord
Rayleigh<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn43" id="fna43" name="fna43">43</a></sup>, were founded in 1909.</p>

<p>Until about 1770, the senate-house examination
had been oral, but it began now to be the custom to
dictate some or all of the questions and to require
answers to be written. Only one question was
dictated at a time, and a fresh one was not given
out until some student had solved that previously
read: a custom which by causing perpetual interruptions
to take down new questions must have
proved very harassing. We are perhaps apt to
think that an examination conducted by written
papers is so natural that the custom is of long
continuance, but I know no record of any in
Europe earlier than the eighteenth century. Until
1830 the questions for the Smith’s prizes were
dictated.</p>

<p><a name="png.275" id="png.275" href="#png.275"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The following description of the senate-house examination
as it existed in 1772 was given by Jebb<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn44" id="fna44" name="fna44">44</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moderators, some days before the arrival of the
time prescribed by the vice-chancellor, meet for the purpose
of forming the students into divisions of six, eight, or ten,
according to their performance in the schools, with a view
to the ensuing examination.</p>

<p>Upon the first of the appointed days, at eight o’clock in
the morning, the students enter the senate-house, preceded
by a master of arts from each college, who ... is called the
“father” of the <span class="nw">college....</span></p>

<p>After the proctors have called over the names, each of
the moderators sends for a division of the students: they
sit with him round a table, with pens, ink, and paper, before
them: he enters upon his task of examination, and does not
dismiss the set till the hour is expired. This examination
has now for some years been held in the English language.</p>

<p>The examination is varied according to the abilities of
the students. The moderator generally begins with proposing
some questions from the six books of Euclid, plain
(<i>sic</i>) trigonometry, and the first rules of algebra. If any
person fails in an answer, the question goes to the next.
From the elements of mathematics, a transition is made to
the four branches of philosophy, viz. mechanics, hydrostatics,
apparent astronomy, and optics, as explained in the
works of Maclaurin, Cotes, Helsham, Hamilton, Rutherforth,
Keill, Long, Ferguson, and Smith. If the moderator finds
the set of questionists, under examination, capable of answering
him, he proceeds to the eleventh and twelfth books of
Euclid, conic sections, spherical trigonometry, the higher
parts of Algebra, and sir Isaac Newton’s Principia; more
particularly those sections, which treat of the motion of
<a name="png.276" id="png.276" href="#png.276"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bodies in eccentric and revolving orbits; the mutual action
of spheres, composed of particles attracting each other according
to various laws; the theory of pulses, propagated
through elastic mediums; and the stupendous fabric of the
world. Having closed the philosophical examination, he
sometimes asks a few questions in Locke’s Essay on the
human understanding, Butler’s Analogy, or Clarke’s Attributes.
But as the highest academical distinctions are invariably
given to the best proficients in mathematics and
natural philosophy, a very superficial knowledge in morality
and metaphysics will suffice.</p>

<p>When the division under examination is one of the
highest classes, problems are also proposed, with which the
student retires to a distant part of the senate-house, and
returns, with his solution upon paper, to the moderator,
who, at his leisure, compares it with the solutions of other
students, to whom the same problems have been proposed.</p>

<p>The extraction of roots, the arithmetic of surds, the invention
of divisers, the resolution of quadratic, cubic, and
biquadratic equations; together with the doctrine of fluxions,
and its application to the solution of questions “de maximis
et minimis,” to the finding of areas, to the rectification of
curves, the investigation of the centers of gravity and oscillation,
and to the circumstances of bodies, agitated, according
to various laws, by centripetal forces, as unfolded, and
exemplified, in the fluxional treatises of Lyons, Saunderson,
Simpson, Emerson, Maclaurin, and Newton, generally form
the subject matter of these problems.</p>

<p>When the clock strikes nine, the questionists are dismissed
to breakfast: they return at half-past nine, and stay
till eleven; they go in again at half-past one, and stay till
three; and, lastly, they return at half-past three, and stay
till five.</p>

<p><a name="png.277" id="png.277" href="#png.277"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The hours of attendance are the same upon the subsequent
day.</p>

<p>On the third day they are finally dismissed at eleven.</p>

<p>During the hours of attendance, every division is twice
examined in form, once by each of the moderators, who are
engaged for the whole time in this employment.</p>

<p>As the questionists are examined in divisions of only
six or eight at a time, but a small portion of the whole
number is engaged, at any particular hour, with the moderators;
and, therefore, if there were no further examination,
much time would remain unemployed.</p>

<p>But the moderator’s inquiry into the merits of the candidates
forms the least material part of the examination.</p>

<p>The “fathers” of the respective colleges, zealous for the
credit of the societies, of which they are the guardians, are
incessantly employed in examining those students, who
appear most likely to contest the palm of glory with their
sons.</p>

<p>This part of the process is as follows:</p>

<p>The father of a college takes a student of a different
college aside, and, sometimes for an hour and an half together,
strictly examines him in every part of mathematics
and philosophy, which he professes to have read.</p>

<p>After he hath, from this examination, formed an accurate
idea of the student’s abilities and acquired knowledge, he
makes a report of his absolute or comparative merit to the
moderators, and to every other father who shall ask him
the question.</p>

<p>Besides the fathers, all masters of arts, and doctors, of
whatever faculty they be, have the liberty of examining
whom they please; and they also report the event of each
trial, to every person who shall make the inquiry.</p>

<p>The moderators and fathers meet at breakfast, and at
dinner. From the variety of reports, taken in connection
<a name="png.278" id="png.278" href="#png.278"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>270<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with their own examination, the former are enabled, about
the close of the second day, so far to settle the comparative
merits of the candidates, as to agree upon the names of
four-and-twenty, who to them appear most deserving of
being distinguished by marks of academical approbation.</p>

<p>These four-and-twenty [wranglers and senior optimes]
are recommended to the proctors for their private examination;
and, if approved by them, and no reason appears
against such placing of them from any subsequent inquiry,
their names are set down in two divisions, according to
that order, in which they deserve to stand; are afterwards
printed; and read over upon a solemn day, in the presence
of the vice-chancellor, and of the assembled university.</p>

<p>The names of the twelve [junior optimes], who, in the
course of the examination, appear next in desert, are also
printed, and are read over, in the presence of the vice-chancellor,
and of the assembled university, upon a day
subsequent to the <span class="nw">former....</span></p>

<p>The students, who appear to have merited neither praise
nor censure [the poll-men], pass unnoticed: while those,
who have taken no pains to prepare themselves for the examination,
and have appeared with discredit in the schools,
are distinguished by particular tokens of disgrace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Jebb’s statement about the number of wranglers
and senior optimes is only approximate.</p>

<p>It may be added that it was now frankly recognized
that the examination was competitive<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn45" id="fna45" name="fna45">45</a></sup>. Also
that though it was open to any member of the
senate to take part in it, yet the determination of
the relative merit of the students was entirely in the
<a name="png.279" id="png.279" href="#png.279"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>271<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hands of the moderators<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn46" id="fna46" name="fna46">46</a></sup>. Although the examination
did not occupy more than three days it
must have been a severe physical trial to anyone
who was delicate. It was held in winter and in
the senate-house: that building was then noted for
its draughts, and was not warmed in any way; and,
according to tradition, on one occasion the candidates
on entering in the morning found the ink
frozen in the pots on their desks.</p>

<p>The University was not altogether satisfied<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn47" id="fna47" name="fna47">47</a></sup>
with the regulations, and in 1779<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn48" id="fna48" name="fna48">48</a></sup> the scheme of
examination was amended in various respects. In
particular the examination was extended to four
days, a third day being given up entirely to natural
religion, moral philosophy, and Locke’s <cite>Essay</cite>. It
was further announced<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn49" id="fna49" name="fna49">49</a></sup> that a candidate would not
receive credit for advanced subjects unless he had
satisfied the examiners in Euclid’s <cite>Elements</cite> and
elementary natural philosophy.</p>

<p>A system of brackets or “classes quam minimae”
was now introduced. Under this system the examiners
issued on the morning of the fourth day a
provisional list of men who had obtained honours,
with the names of those of about equal merit
bracketed, and that day was devoted to arranging
<a name="png.280" id="png.280" href="#png.280"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>272<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the names in each bracket in order of merit: the
examiners being given explicit authority to invite
the assistance of others in this work. Whether at
this time a candidate could request to be re-examined
with the view of being moved from one
bracket to another is uncertain, but later this also
was allowed.</p>

<p>The number of examiners was also increased
to four, the moderators of one year becoming, as
a matter of course, the examiners of the next.
Thus of the four examiners in each year, two had
taken part in the examination of the previous year,
and the continuity of the system of examination
was maintained. The names of the moderators
appear on the tripos lists, but the names of the
examiners were not printed on the lists till some
years later.</p>

<p>The right of any master of arts to take part in
the examination was not affected, though henceforth
it was exercised more sparingly, and I believe
was not insisted on after 1785. But it became a
regular custom for the moderators to invite particular
residents to examine and compare specified
candidates: Milner, of Queens’, was constantly
asked to assist in this way.</p>

<p>It was not long before it became an established
custom that a candidate, who was dissatisfied with
the class in which he had been placed as the result
<a name="png.281" id="png.281" href="#png.281"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>273<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of his disputations, might challenge it before the
examination began. This power seems to have been
used but rarely; it was, however, a recognition of the
fact that a place in the tripos list was to be determined
by the senate-house examination alone, and
the examiners soon acquired the habit of settling the
preliminary classes without exclusive reference to
the previous disputations.</p>

<p>The earliest extant paper actually set in the
senate-house, to which we can with certainty refer,
is a problem paper set in 1785 or 1786 by W. Hodson,
of Trinity, then a proctor. The autograph
copy from which he gave out the questions was
luckily preserved, and is in the library<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn50" id="fna50" name="fna50">50</a></sup> of Trinity
College. It must be almost the last problem paper
which was dictated, instead of being printed and
given as a whole to the candidates. The paper is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parnumber">1.</span> To determine the velocity with which a Body must
be thrown, in a direction parallel to the Horizon, so as to
become a secondary planet to the Earth; as also to describe
a parabola, and never return.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">2.</span> To demonstrate, supposing the force to vary as
<span class="maths">1 / <i>D</i>²</span> how far a body must fall both within and without the
Circle to acquire the Velocity with which a body revolves
in a Circle.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber"><a name="png.282" id="png.282" href="#png.282"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>274<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>3.</span> Suppose a body to be turned (<i>sic</i>) upwards with the
Velocity with which it revolves in an Ellipse, how high will
it ascend? The same is asked supposing it to move in a
parabola.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">4.</span> Suppose a force varying first as <span class="maths">1 / <i>D</i>³,</span> secondly in a
greater ratio than <span class="maths">1 / <i>D</i>²</span> but less than
<span class="maths">1 / <i>D</i>³,</span> and thirdly in a
less ratio than <span class="maths">1 / <i>D</i>²,</span> in each of these Cases to determine
whether at all, and where the body parting from the higher
Apsid will come to the lower.</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">5.</span> To determine in what situation of the moon’s Apsid
they go most forwards, and in what situation of her Nodes
the Nodes go most backwards, and why?</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">6.</span> In the cubic equation <span class="maths"><i>x</i>³ + <i>qx</i> + <i>r</i> = 0</span> which wants
the second term; supposing <span class="maths"><i>x = a + b</i></span> and
<span class="maths">3<i>ab = −q</i>,</span> to
determine the value of <span class="maths"><i>x</i>.</span> (<i>sic.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">7.</span> To find the fluxion of <span class="maths"><i>x<sup>r</sup></i> × (<i>y<sup>n</sup> + z<sup>m</sup></i>)<sup>1/<i>q</i></sup>.</span></p>

<p><span class="parnumber">8.</span> To find the fluent of <span class="maths" title="a[xdot]/(a+x)"><i>aẋ</i> / (<i>a + x</i>).</span></p>

<p><span class="parnumber">9.</span> To find the fluxion of the <span class="maths"><i>m</i><sup>th</sup></span> power of the Logarithm

<p><span class="parnumber">10.</span> Of right-angled Triangles containing a given Area
to find that whereof the sum of the two legs <span class="maths"><i>AB + BC</i></span> shall

are illustrated by diagrams. The angle at <span class="maths"><i>B</i></span> is the right
angle.]</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">11.</span> To find the Surface of the Cone <span class="maths"><i>ABC</i>.</span> [The cone
is a right one on a circular base.]</p>

<p><span class="parnumber">12.</span> To rectify the arc <span class="maths"><i>DB</i></span> of the semicircle <span class="maths"><i>DBV</i>.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In cases of equality in the senate-house examination,
the acts were still taken into account in settling
<a name="png.283" id="png.283" href="#png.283"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>275<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the tripos order: and in 1786, when the second, third,
and fourth wranglers came out equal in the examination,
a memorandum was published that the second
place was given to that candidate who <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">dialectis magis
est versatus</i>, and the third place to that one who <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">in
scholis sophistarum melius disputavit</i>.</p>

<p>At this time there were various intervals in
the examination by the moderators, and the examinations
by the extraneous examiners took place
in these intervals. Those candidates who at any
time were not being examined occupied themselves
with amusements, provided they were not too
boisterous and obvious: probably dice and cards
played a large part in them. Gunning in an amusing
account of his examination in 1788 talks of playing
with a teetotum<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn51" id="fna51" name="fna51">51</a></sup> on the Wednesday (when specified
works by Locke and Paley formed the subjects of
examination), and says this game “was carried on
with great spirit ... by considerable numbers during
the whole of the examination.”</p>

<p>About this period, 1790, the custom of printing
the problem papers was introduced, but until 1828
the other papers continued to be dictated. Since
then all the papers have been printed.</p>

<p>I insert here the following letter<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn52" id="fna52" name="fna52">52</a></sup> from William
<a name="png.284" id="png.284" href="#png.284"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>276<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Gooch, of Caius, in which he described his examination
in the senate-house in 1791. It must be remembered
that it is the letter of an undergraduate
addressed to his father and mother, and was not
intended either for preservation or publication: a
fact which certainly does not detract from its value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="h3"><i>Monday</i> ¼ aft. 12.</p>

<p>We have been examin’d this Morning in pure Mathematics
&amp; I’ve hitherto kept just about even with Peacock
which is much more than I expected. We are going at
1 o’clock to be examin’d till 3 in Philosophy.</p>

<p>From 1 till 7 I did more than Peacock; But who did
most at Moderator’s Rooms this Evening from 7 till 9, I
don’t know yet;—but I did above three times as much as
the Sen<sup>r</sup> Wrangler last year, yet I’m afraid not so much as
Peacock.</p>

<p>Between One &amp; three o’Clock I wrote up 9 sheets of
Scribbling Paper so you may suppose I was pretty fully
employ’d.</p>

<p class="h3"><i>Tuesday Night.</i></p>

<p>I’ve been shamefully us’d by Lax to-day;—Tho’ his
anxiety for Peacock must (of course) be very great, I never
suspected that his Partially (<i>sic</i>) w<sup>d</sup> get the better of his
Justice. I had entertain’d too high an opinion of him to
suppose it.—he gave Peacock a long private Examination &amp;
then came to me (I hop’d) on the same subject, but ’twas
only to <em>Bully</em> me as much as he could,—whatever I said
(tho’ right) he tried to convert into Nonsense by seeming to
misunderstand me. However I don’t entirely dispair of
being first, tho’ you see Lax seems determin’d that I shall
not.—I had no Idea (before I went into the Senate-House)
of being able to contend at all with Peacock.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="png.285" id="png.285" href="#png.285"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>277<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><i>Wednesday evening.</i></p>

<p>Peacock &amp; I are still in perfect Equilibrio &amp; the Examiners
themselves can give no guess yet who is likely to be
first;—a New Examiner (Wood of St. John’s, who is reckon’d
the first Mathematician in the University, for Waring doesn’t
reside) was call’d solely to examine Peacock &amp; me only.—but
by this new Plan nothing is yet determin’d.—So Wood
is to examine us again to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class="h3"><i>Thursday evening.</i></p>

<p>Peacock is declar’d first &amp; I second,—Smith of this Coll.
is either 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; Lucas is either 10<sup>th</sup> or 11<sup>th</sup>.—Poor
Quiz Carver is one of the
<span title="[Greek: hoi polloi]" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">οἱ πολλοί</span>;—I’m perfectly <em>satisfied</em>
that the Senior Wranglership is Peacock’s due, but <em>certainly</em>
not so very undisputably as Lax pleases to represent it—I
understand that <em>he</em> asserts ’twas 5 to 4 in Peacock’s favor.
Now Peacock &amp; I have explain’d to each other how we went
on, &amp; can <em>prove indisputably</em> that it wasn’t 20 to 19 in
his favor;—I <em>cannot</em> therefore be displeas’d for being plac’d
second, tho’ I’m provov’d (<i>sic</i>) with Lax for his false report
(so much beneath the Character of a <span class="nw">Gentleman.)—</span></p>

<p>N.B. it is my very <em>particular Request</em> that you dont
mention Lax’s behaviour to me to any one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such was the form ultimately taken by the
senate-house examination, a form which it retained
substantially without alteration for nearly half-a-century.
It soon became the sole test by which
candidates were judged. The University was not
obliged to grant a degree to anyone who performed
the statutable exercises, and it was open
to the senate to refuse to pass a supplicat for a
bachelor’s degree in arts unless the candidate had
<a name="png.286" id="png.286" href="#png.286"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>278<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>presented himself for the senate-house examination.
In 1790 James Blackburn, of Trinity, a questionist
of exceptional abilities, was informed that in spite
of his good disputations he would not be allowed a
degree unless he also satisfied the examiners in the
tripos. He accordingly solved one “very hard
problem,” though in consequence of a dispute with
the authorities he refused to attempt any more<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn53" id="fna53" name="fna53">53</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Henceforth the examination was compulsory on
all candidates pursuing the normal course for the
B.A. degree. In 1791 the University laid down
rules<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn54" id="fna54" name="fna54">54</a></sup> for its conduct, so far as it concerned poll-men,
decreeing that those who passed were to be
classified in four divisions or classes, the names in
each class to be arranged alphabetically, but not to
be printed on the official tripos lists. The classes
in the final lists must be distinguished from the
eight preliminary classes issued before the commencement
of the examination. The men in the
first six preliminary classes were expected to take
honours; those in the seventh and eighth preliminary
classes were <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">primâ facie</i> poll-men.</p>

<p>In 1799 the moderators announced<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn55" id="fna55" name="fna55">55</a></sup> that for the
future they would require every candidate to show
<a name="png.287" id="png.287" href="#png.287"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a competent knowledge of the first book of Euclid’s
<cite>Elements</cite>, arithmetic, vulgar and decimal fractions,
simple and quadratic equations, and selected books
by Locke and Paley. Paley’s works seem to be
held in esteem by modern divines, and his <cite>Evidences</cite>,
though not his <cite>Philosophy</cite>, still remains (1917) one
of the subjects of the Previous Examination, but his
contemporaries thought less highly of his writings, or
at any rate of his philosophy. Thus Best is quoted by
Wordsworth<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn56" id="fna56" name="fna56">56</a></sup> as saying of Paley’s <cite>Philosophy</cite>, “The
tutors of Cambridge no doubt neutralize by their
judicious remarks, when they read it to their pupils,
all that is pernicious in its principles”: so also
Richard Watson, bishop of Llandaff, in his anecdotal
autobiography<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn57" id="fna57" name="fna57">57</a></sup>, says, in describing the senate-house
examination in which Paley was senior wrangler, that
Paley was afterwards known to the world by many
excellent productions, “though there are some ...
principles in his philosophy which I by no means
approve.”</p>

<p>In 1800 the moderators extended to all men in
the first four preliminary classes the privilege of
being allowed to attempt the problem papers:
hitherto this privilege had been confined to candidates
placed in the first two classes. Until 1828
the problem papers were set in the evenings, and
<a name="png.288" id="png.288" href="#png.288"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>280<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the rooms of the moderator, but many of the
so-called problems were really pieces of bookwork
or easy riders. No problems were ever set to the
men in the seventh and eighth preliminary classes,
which contained the poll-men.</p>

<p>The <cite>University Calendars</cite> date from 1796, and
from 1802 to 1882 inclusive contain the printed
tripos papers of the previous January. The papers
from 1801 to 1820 and from 1838 to 1849 inclusive
were also published in separate volumes, which are
to be found in most public libraries. None of the
bookwork papers of this time are now extant, but
it is believed that they contained few, if any, riders.
In looking at these papers to form an opinion of
the knowledge current at the time it is necessary
to bear in mind that the text-books then in circulation
were far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>The <cite>Calendar</cite> of 1802 contains a diffuse account
of the examination. It commences as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the Monday morning, a little before eight o’clock,
the students, generally about a hundred, enter the Senate-House,
preceded by a master of arts, who on this occasion
is styled the father of the College to which he belongs. On
two pillars at the entrance of the Senate-House are hung
the classes and a paper denoting the hours of examination
of those who are thought most competent to contend for
honours. Immediately after the University clock has struck
eight, the names are called over, and the absentees, being
marked, are subject to certain fines. The classes to be
<a name="png.289" id="png.289" href="#png.289"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>examined are called out, and proceed to their appointed
tables, where they find pens, ink, and paper provided in
great abundance. In this manner, with the utmost order
and regularity, two-thirds of the young men are set to work
within less than five minutes after the clock has struck
eight. There are three chief tables, at which six examiners
preside. At the first, the senior moderator of the present
year and the junior moderator of the preceding year. At
the second, the junior moderator of the present, and the
senior moderator of the preceding year. At the third, two
moderators of the year previous to the two last, or two
examiners appointed by the Senate. The two first tables
are chiefly allotted to the six first classes; the third, or
largest, to the <span title="[Greek: hoi polloi]" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">οἱ πολλοί</span>.</p>

<p>The young men hear the propositions or questions delivered
by the examiners; they instantly apply themselves;
demonstrate, prove, work out and write down, fairly and
legibly (otherwise their labour is of little avail) the answers
required. All is silence; nothing heard save the voice of
the examiners; or the gentle request of some one, who may
wish a repetition of the enunciation. It requires every
person to use the utmost dispatch; for as soon as ever the
examiners perceive anyone to have finished his paper and
subscribed his name to it another question is immediately
<span class="nw">given....</span></p>

<p>The examiners are not seated, but keep moving round
the tables, both to judge how matters proceed and to deliver
their questions at proper intervals. The examination, which
embraces arithmetic, algebra, fluxions, the doctrine of
infinitesimals and increments, geometry, trigonometry,
mechanics, hydrostatics, optics, and astronomy, in all their
various gradations, is varied according to circumstances:
no one can anticipate a question, for in the course of five
minutes he may be dragged from Euclid to Newton, from
<a name="png.290" id="png.290" href="#png.290"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the humble arithmetic of Bonnycastle to the abstruse
analytics of Waring. While this examination is proceeding
at the three tables between the hours of eight and nine,
printed problems are delivered to each person of the first
and second classes; these he takes with him to any window
he pleases, where there are pens, ink, and paper prepared
for his operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The examination began at eight o’clock in the
morning. At nine the papers had to be given up, and
half-an-hour was allowed for breakfast. At half-past
nine the candidates came back, and were examined
in the way described above till eleven, when the
senate-house was again cleared. An interval of two
hours then took place. At one o’clock all returned
to be again examined. At three the senate-house
was cleared for half-an-hour, and, on the return of
the candidates, the examination was continued till
five. At seven in the evening the first four classes
went to the senior moderator’s rooms to solve problems.
They were finally dismissed for the day at
nine, after eight hours of examination. The work
of Tuesday was similar to that of Monday: Wednesday
was partly devoted to logic and moral philosophy.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock on Thursday morning a first
list was published with all candidates of about
equal merits bracketed. Until nine o’clock a candidate
had the right to challenge anyone above him
to an examination to see which was the better. At
<a name="png.291" id="png.291" href="#png.291"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>283<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>nine a second list came out, and a candidate’s right
of challenge was then confined to the bracket immediately
above his own. If he proved himself the
equal of or better than the man so challenged his
name was transferred to the upper bracket. To
challenge and then to fail to substantiate the claim
to removal to a higher bracket was considered rather
ridiculous. Revised lists were published at eleven,
three, and five, according to the results of the
examination during that day. At five the whole
examination ended. The proctors, moderators, and
examiners then retired to a room under the public
library to prepare the list of honours, which was
sometimes settled in a few hours, but sometimes not
before two or three the next morning. The name
of the senior wrangler was generally announced at
midnight, and the rest of the list the next morning.
In 1802 there were eighty-six candidates for honours,
and they were divided into fifteen brackets, the first
and second brackets containing each one name only,
and the third bracket four names.</p>

<p>It is clear from the above account that the competition
fostered by the examination had developed
so much as to threaten to impair its usefulness as
guiding the studies of the men. On the other hand,
there can be no doubt that the carefully devised
arrangements for obtaining an accurate order of
merit stimulated the best men to throw all their
<a name="png.292" id="png.292" href="#png.292"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>284<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>energies into the work for the examination. It is
easy to point out the double-edged result of a strict
order of merit. The problem before the University
was to retain its advantages while checking any
abuses to which it might lead.</p>

<p>It was the privilege of the moderators to entertain
the proctors and some of the leading resident
mathematicians the night before the issue of the
final list, and to communicate that list in confidence
to their guests. This pleasant custom survived till
1884. I revived the practice in 1890 when acting
as senior moderator, but it seems to have now
ceased.</p>

<p>In 1806 Sir Frederick Pollock was senior wrangler,
and in 1869 in answer to an appeal from De
Morgan for an account of the mathematical study
of men at the beginning of the century he wrote a
letter<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn58" id="fna58" name="fna58">58</a></sup> which is sufficiently interesting to bear
reproduction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I shall write in answer to your inquiry, <em>all</em> about my
books, my study, and my degree, and leave you to settle all
about the proprieties which my letter may give rise to, as
to egotism, modesty, &amp;c. The only books I read the first
year were Wood’s <cite>Algebra</cite> (as far as quadratic equations),
Bonnycastle’s ditto, and <cite>Euclid</cite> (Simpson’s). In the second
year I read Wood (beyond quadratic equations), and Wood
and Vince, for what they called the <em>branches</em>. In the third
year I read the <cite>Jesuit’s</cite> Newton and Vince’s <cite>Fluxions</cite>; these
were all the <em>books</em>, but there were certain <span class="allsc">MSS.</span> floating about
<a name="png.293" id="png.293" href="#png.293"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>285<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which I copied—which belonged to Dealtry, second wrangler
in Kempthorne’s year. I have no doubt that I had read
less and seen fewer books than any senior wrangler of about
my time, or any period since; but what I knew I knew
thoroughly, and it was completely at my fingers’ ends. I
consider that I was the last <em>geometrical</em> and <em>fluxional</em> senior
wrangler; I was not up to the <em>differential</em> calculus, and never
acquired it. I went up to college with a knowledge of
Euclid and algebra to quadratic equations, nothing more;
and I never read any second year’s lore during my first year,
nor any third year’s lore during my second; my <i>forte</i> was,
that what I <em>did</em> know I <em>could produce at any moment with</em>
<span class="allsc">PERFECT</span> <em>accuracy</em>. I could repeat the first book of Euclid
word by word and letter by letter. During my first year I
was not a “<em>reading</em>” man (so called); I had no expectation
of honours or a fellowship, and I attended all the lectures
on all subjects—Harwood’s anatomical, Wollaston’s chemical,
and Farish’s mechanical lectures—but the examination
at the end of the first year revealed to me my powers. I
was not only in the first class, but it was generally understood
I was <em>first</em> in the first class; neither I nor anyone for
me expected I should get in at all. Now, as I had taken
no pains to prepare (taking, however, marvellous pains
while the examination was going on), I knew better than
anyone else the value of my <em>examination qualities</em> (great
rapidity and perfect accuracy); and I said to myself, “If
you’re not an ass, you’ll be senior wrangler”; and <em>I took to
“reading” accordingly</em>. A curious circumstance occurred
when the Brackets came out in the Senate-house declaring
the result of the examination: I saw at the top the name
of Walter <em>bracketed alone</em> (as he was); in the bracket below
were <em>Fiott</em>, <em>Hustler</em>, <em>Jephson</em>. I looked down and could not
find my own name till I got to Bolland, when my pride took
fire, and I said, “I must have beaten <em>that man</em>, so I will
<a name="png.294" id="png.294" href="#png.294"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>286<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>look up again”; and on looking up carefully I found the
nail had been passed through my name, and I was at the
top bracketed <em>alone</em>, even above Walter. You may judge
what my feelings were at this discovery; it is the only instance
of two such brackets, and it made my fortune—that
is, made me independent, and gave me an immense college
reputation. It was said I was more than half of the examination
before anyone else. The two moderators were
Hornbuckle, of St John’s, and Brown (Saint Brown), of
Trinity. The Johnian congratulated me. I said perhaps
I might be challenged; he said, “Well, if you are you’re
quite safe—you may sit down and do nothing, and no
one would get up to you in a whole <span class="nw">day.” ...</span></p>

<p>Latterly the Cambridge examinations seem to turn upon
very different matters from what prevailed in my time. I
think a Cambridge education has for its object to make good
members of society—not to extend science and make profound
mathematicians. The tripos questions in the Senate-house
ought not to go beyond certain limits, and geometry
ought to be cultivated and encouraged much more than it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this De Morgan replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your letter suggests much, because it gives possibility
of answer. The <em>branches</em> of algebra of course mainly refer
to the second part of Wood, now called the theory of equations.
Waring was his guide. Turner—whom you must
remember as head of Pembroke, senior wrangler of 1767—told
a young man in the hearing of my informant to be sure
and attend to quadratic equations. “It was a quadratic,”
said he, “made me senior wrangler.” It seems to me that
the Cambridge <em>revivers</em> were [Woodhouse,] Waring, Paley,
Vince, Milner.</p>

<p>You had Dealtry’s <span class="allsc">MSS.</span> He afterwards published a
very good book on fluxions. He merged his mathematical
<a name="png.295" id="png.295" href="#png.295"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>287<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fame in that of a Claphamite Christian. It is something
to know that the tutor’s <span class="allsc">MS.</span> was in vogue in 1800–1806.</p>

<p>Now—how did you get your conic sections? How much
of Newton did you read? From Newton direct, or from
tutor’s manuscript?</p>

<p>Surely Fiott was our old friend Dr Lee. I missed being
a pupil of Hustler by a few weeks. He retired just before
I went up in February 1823. The echo of Hornbuckle’s
answer to you about the challenge has lighted on Whewell,
who, it is said, wanted to challenge Jacob, and was answered
that he could not beat [him] if he were to write the whole
day and the other wrote nothing. I do not believe that
Whewell would have listened to any such dissuasion.</p>

<p>I doubt your being the last fluxional senior wrangler.
So far as I know, Gipps, Langdale, Alderson, Dicey, Neale,
may contest this point with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer, dated 7 August 1869, of Sir Frederick
Pollock to these questions was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have put together as <em>revivers</em> five very different
men. Woodhouse was better than Waring, who could not
prove Wilson’s (Judge of C. P.) guess about the property
of prime numbers; but Woodhouse (I think) did prove it,
and a beautiful proof it is. Vince was a bungler, and I
think utterly insensible of mathematical beauty.</p>

<p>Now for your questions. I did not get my conic sections
from Vince. I copied a <span class="allsc">MS.</span> of Dealtry. I fell in love with
the cone and its sections, and everything about it. I have
never forsaken my favourite pursuit; I delighted in such
problems as two spheres touching each other and also the
inside of a hollow cone, &amp;c. As to Newton, I read a good deal
(men <em>now</em> read nothing), but I read much of the notes. I detected
a blunder which nobody seemed to be aware of. Tavel,
tutor of Trinity, was not; and he argued very favourably
<a name="png.296" id="png.296" href="#png.296"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>288<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of me in consequence. The application of the Principia
I got from <span class="allsc">MSS.</span> The blunder was this: in calculating the
resistance of a globe at the end of a cylinder oscillating in
a resisting medium they had forgotten to notice that there
is a difference between the resistance to a globe and a circle
of the same diameter.</p>

<p>The story of Whewell and Jacob cannot be true. Whewell
was a very, <em>very</em> considerable man, I think not a <em>great</em>
man. I have no doubt Jacob beat him in accuracy, but
the supposed answer <em>cannot</em> be true; it is a mere echo of
what actually passed between me and Hornbuckle on the
day the Tripos came out—for the truth of which I vouch.
I think the examiners are taking too <em>practical</em> a turn; it is
a waste of time to calculate <em>actually</em> a longitude by the help
of logarithmic tables and lunar observations. It would be
a fault not to know <em>how</em>, but a greater to be handy at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few minor changes in the senate-house examination
were made in 1808<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn59" id="fna59" name="fna59">59</a></sup>. A fifth day was added
to the examination. Of the five days thus given up
to it three were devoted to mathematics, one to
logic, philosophy, and religion, and one to the
arrangement of the brackets. Apart from the
evening paper the examination on each of the first
three days lasted six hours: of these eighteen
hours, eleven were assigned to bookwork and seven
to problems. The problem papers were set from
six to ten in the evening.</p>

<p>A letter from Whewell, dated 19 January 1816,
thus describes his examination in the senate-house<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn60" id="fna60" name="fna60">60</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="png.297" id="png.297" href="#png.297"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>289<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Jacob. Whewell. Such is the order in which we are
fixed after a week’s <span class="nw">examination....</span> I had before been given
to understand that a great deal depended upon being able
to write the greatest possible quantity in the smallest time,
but of the rapidity which was actually necessary I had
formed the most distant idea. I am upon no occasion a
quick writer, and upon subjects where I could not go on
without sometimes thinking a little I soon found myself
considerably behind. I was therefore surprised, and even
astonished, to find myself bracketed off, as it is called, in
the second place; that is, on the day when a new division
of the classes is made for the purpose of having a closer
examination of the respective merits of men who come pretty
near to each other, I was not classed with anybody, but
placed alone in the second bracket. The man who is at
the head of the list is of Caius College, and was always expected
to be very high, though I do not know that anybody
expected to see him so decidedly superior as to be bracketed
off by himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The tendency to cultivate mechanical rapidity was
a grave evil, and lasted long after Whewell’s time.
According to rumour the highest honours in 1845
were obtained by assiduous practice in writing<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn61" id="fna61" name="fna61">61</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The devotion of the Cambridge school to geometrical
and fluxional methods had led to its isolation
from contemporary continental mathematicians.
Early in the nineteenth century the evil consequence
of this began to be recognized; and it was felt to be
little less than a scandal that the researches of
<a name="png.298" id="png.298" href="#png.298"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>290<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre were unknown to
many Cambridge mathematicians save by repute.
An attempt to explain the notation and methods of
the calculus as used on the continent was made by
Woodhouse, later professor in the University, who
stands out as the apostle of the new movement.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if Woodhouse could have brought
analytical methods into vogue by himself; but
his views were enthusiastically adopted by three
students, Peacock, Babbage, and Herschel, who
succeeded in carrying out the reforms he had suggested.
They created an Analytical Society which
Babbage explained was formed to advocate “the
principles of pure <i>d</i>-ism as opposed to the <i>dot</i>-age of
the University.” The character of the instruction
in mathematics at the University has at all times
largely depended on the text-books in use, and
the importance of good books of this class was
emphasized by a traditional rule that questions
should not be set on a new subject in the tripos
unless it had been discussed in some treatise suitable
and available for Cambridge students<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn62" id="fna62" name="fna62">62</a></sup>. Hence the
importance attached to the publication of the work
on analytical trigonometry by Woodhouse in 1809,
and of the works on the differential calculus issued
by members of the Analytical Society in 1816 and
1820.</p>

<p><a name="png.299" id="png.299" href="#png.299"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>291<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>In 1817 Peacock, who was moderator, introduced
the symbols for differentiation into the papers set in
the senate-house examination; his colleague, however,
continued to use the fluxional notation.
Peacock himself wrote on 17 March 1817 (<i>i.e.</i> shortly
after the examination) on the subject as follows<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn63" id="fna63" name="fna63">63</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I assure you ... that I shall never cease to exert myself
to the utmost in the cause of reform, and that I will never
decline any office which may increase my power to effect
it. I am nearly certain of being nominated to the office of
Moderator in the year 1818–19, and as I am an examiner in
virtue of my office, for the next year I shall pursue a course
even more decided than hitherto, since I shall feel that men
have been prepared for the change, and will then be enabled
to have acquired a better system by the publication of improved
elementary books. I have considerable influence as
a lecturer, and I will not neglect it. It is by silent perseverance
only that we can hope to reduce the many-headed
monster of prejudice, and make the University answer her
character as the loving mother of good learning and science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1818 all candidates for honours, that is, all
men in the first six preliminary classes, were allowed
to attempt the problems: this change was made by
the moderators.</p>

<p>In 1819 Peacock, who was again moderator, induced
his colleague to adopt the new notation. It
was employed in the next year by Whewell, and in
the following year by Peacock again. Henceforth
<a name="png.300" id="png.300" href="#png.300"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>292<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the calculus in its modern language and analytical
methods were freely used, new subjects were introduced,
and for many years the examination provided
a mathematical training fairly abreast of the
times.</p>

<p>By this time the disputations had ceased to have
any immediate effect on a man’s place in the tripos.
Thus Whewell<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn64" id="fna64" name="fna64">64</a></sup>, writing about his duties as moderator
in 1820, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would get very exaggerated ideas of the importance
attached to it [an Act] if you were to trust Cumberland;
I believe it was formerly more thought of than it is now.
It does not, at least immediately, produce any effect on a
man’s place in the tripos, and is therefore considerably less
attended to than used to be the case, and in most years is
not very interesting after the five or six best men: so that
I look for a considerable exercise of, or rather demand for,
patience on my part. The other part of my duty in the
Senate House consists in manufacturing wranglers, senior
optimes, etc. and is, while it lasts, very laborious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the examination itself in this year he wrote as
follows<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn65" id="fna65" name="fna65">65</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The examination in the Senate House begins to-morrow,
and is rather close work while it lasts. We are employed
from seven in the morning till five in the evening in giving
out questions and receiving written answers to them; and
when that is over, we have to read over all the papers which
<a name="png.301" id="png.301" href="#png.301"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>293<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>we have received in the course of the day, to determine who
have done best, which is a business that in numerous years
has often kept the examiners up the half of every night;
but this year is not particularly numerous. In addition
to all this, the examination is conducted in a building which
happens to be a very beautiful one, with a marble floor and
a highly ornamented ceiling; and as it is on the model of a
Grecian temple, and as temples had no chimneys, and as a
stove or a fire of any kind might disfigure the building, we
are obliged to take the weather as it happens to be, and when
it is cold we have the full benefit of it—which is likely to
be the case this year. However, it is only a few days, and
we have done with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">A sketch of the examination in the previous year
from the point of view of an examinee was given by
J. M. F. Wright<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn66" id="fna66" name="fna66">66</a></sup>, but there is nothing of special
interest in it.</p>

<p>Sir George B. Airy<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn67" id="fna67" name="fna67">67</a></sup> gave the following sketch of
his recollections of the reading and studies of undergraduates
of his time and of the tripos of 1823, in
which he had been senior wrangler:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At length arrived the Monday morning on which the
examination for the B.A. degree was to <span class="nw">begin....</span> We were
all marched in a body to the Senate-House and placed in
the hands of the Moderators. How the “candidates for
honours” were separated from the <span title="[Greek: hoi polloi]" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">οἱ πολλοί</span> I do not know,
I presume that the Acts and the Opponencies had something
to do with it. The honour candidates were divided into
<a name="png.302" id="png.302" href="#png.302"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>294<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>six groups: and of these Nos. 1 and 2 (united), Nos. 3 and 4
(united), and Nos. 5 and 6 (united), received the questions
of one Moderator. No. 1, Nos. 2 and 3 (united), Nos. 4 and
5 (united), and No. 6, received those of the other Moderator.
The Moderators were reversed on alternate days. There
were no printed question-papers: each examiner had his
bound manuscript of questions, and he read out his first
question; each of the examinees who thought himself able
proceeded to write out his answer, and then orally called
out “Done.” The Moderator, as soon as he thought proper,
proceeded with another question. I think there was only
one course of questions on each day (terminating before
3 o’clock, for the Hall dinner). The examination continued
to Friday mid-day. On Saturday morning, about 8 o’clock,
the list of honours (manuscript) was nailed on the door of
the Senate House.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It must be remembered that for students pursuing
the normal course the senate-house examination
still provided the only avenue to a degree.
That examination involved a knowledge of the
elements of moral philosophy and theology, an acquaintance
with the rules of formal logic, and the
power of reading and writing scholastic Latin, but
mathematics was the predominant subject, and this
led to a certain one-sidedness in education. The
evil of this was generally recognized, and in 1822
various reforms were introduced in the university
curriculum; in particular the Previous Examination
was established for students in their second year,
the subjects being prescribed Greek and Latin works,
<a name="png.303" id="png.303" href="#png.303"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>295<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a Gospel, and Paley’s <cite>Evidences</cite>. Set classical books
were introduced in the final examination of poll-men;
and another honour or tripos examination was
established for classical students. These alterations
came into effect in 1824; and henceforth the senate-house
examination, so far as it related to mathematical
students, was known as the Mathematical
Tripos.</p>

<p>In 1827 the scheme of examination in the mathematical
tripos was revised. By regulations<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn68" id="fna68" name="fna68">68</a></sup> which
came into operation in January 1828, four days,
exclusive of the day of arranging the brackets, were
devoted to the examination; the number of hours of
examination was twenty-three, of which seven were
assigned to problems. On the first two days all the
candidates had the same questions proposed to them,
inclusive of the evening problems, and the examination
on those days excluded the higher and more
difficult parts of mathematics, in order, in the words
of the report, “that the candidates for honours may
not be induced to pursue the more abstruse and
profound mathematics, to the neglect of more
elementary knowledge.” Accordingly, only such
questions as could be solved without the aid of the
differential calculus were set on the first day, and
those set on the second day involved only its elementary
applications. The classes were reduced
<a name="png.304" id="png.304" href="#png.304"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>296<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to four, determined as before by the exercises in the
schools.</p>

<p>The regulations of 1827 definitely prescribed that
all the papers should be printed. They are also
noticeable as being the last which gave the examiners
power to ask <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">vivâ voce</i> questions, though
such questions “were restricted to asking about
propositions contained in the mathematical works
commonly in use at the University, or examples
and explanations of such propositions.” It was
further recommended that no paper should contain
more questions than well-prepared students could
be expected to answer within the time allowed for
it, but that if any candidate, before the end of
the time, had answered all the questions in the
paper, the examiners might propose additional
questions <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">vivâ voce</i>. The power of granting honorary
optime degrees now ceased; it had already
fallen into abeyance. Henceforth the examination
was conducted under definite rules, and I no longer
concern myself with its traditions.</p>

<p>In the same year as these changes became effective
the examination for the poll degree was separated
from the tripos with different sets of papers
and a different schedule of subjects<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn69" id="fna69" name="fna69">69</a></sup>. It was, however,
still nominally considered as forming part of
the senate-house examination, and until 1858 those
<a name="png.305" id="png.305" href="#png.305"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>297<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>who obtained a poll degree were arranged in four
classes, described as fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh,
as if in continuation of the junior optimes or third
class of the tripos.</p>

<p>In the course henceforth ordained for the poll
or ordinary degree, the examination, later known
as “the General,” represents that part of the old
senate-house examination which was intended for
the poll-men, but gradually it was moved to an
earlier period in the normal course taken by the
men. In 1851 admission to the classical tripos<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn70" id="fna70" name="fna70">70</a></sup>
was allowed to others than those who passed the
mathematical tripos, and this provided another
avenue to a degree entirely independent of the old
senate-house examination. In 1852 another set of
examinations, at first called “the Professor’s Examinations,”
and now somewhat modified and
known as “the Specials,” was instituted for all
poll-men to take before they could qualify for a
degree.</p>

<p>In 1858 the fiction that the poll examinations
were part of the senate-house examination was
abandoned, and subsequently they have been
treated as providing an independent method of
obtaining the degree: thus now the mathematical
tripos is the sole representative of the old senate-house
examination. Since 1858 numerous other
<a name="png.306" id="png.306" href="#png.306"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>298<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ways of obtaining a degree in arts have been

subjects.</p>

<p>Further changes in the mathematical tripos were
introduced in 1833<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn71" id="fna71" name="fna71">71</a></sup>. The duration of the examination,
before the issue of the brackets, was extended
to five days, and the number of hours of examination
on each day was fixed at five and a half: seven and
a half hours were assigned to problems. The examination
on the first day was confined to subjects
that did not require the differential calculus, and
only the simplest applications of the calculus were
permitted on the second and third days. During
the first four days of the examination the same
papers were set to all the candidates alike, but on
the fifth day the examination was conducted according
to classes. No reference was made to <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">vivâ
voce</i> questions, though permission was reserved to
re-examine candidates if it were found necessary:
this right remained in force till 1848, but in fact
was never used. In December 1834, a few unimportant
details were amended.</p>

<p>Mr Earnshaw, the senior moderator in 1836, informed
me that he believed that the tripos of that
year was the earliest one in which all the papers
were marked, and that in previous years the
<a name="png.307" id="png.307" href="#png.307"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>299<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>examiners had partly relied on their impression of
the answers given.</p>

<p>New regulations came into force<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn72" id="fna72" name="fna72">72</a></sup> in 1839. The
examination now lasted for six days, and continued
as before for five hours and a half each day: eight
and a half hours were assigned to problems.
Throughout the whole examination the same papers
were set to all candidates, and no reference was
made to any preliminary classes. It was no doubt
in accordance with the spirit of these changes that
the acts in the schools should be abolished, but they
were discontinued by the moderators of 1839 without
the authority of the senate. The examination was
for the future confined<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn73" id="fna73" name="fna73">73</a></sup> to mathematics.</p>

<p>In the same year in which the new scheme came
into force a proposal to reopen the subject was
rejected on 6 March 1839.</p>

<p>The difficulty of bringing professorial lectures
into relation with the needs of students has more
than once been before the University. The desirability
of it was emphasized by a syndicate in
February 1843, which recommended conferences at
stated intervals between the mathematical professors
<a name="png.308" id="png.308" href="#png.308"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>300<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and examiners. This report, which foreshadowed
the creation of a Mathematical Board, was rejected
by the senate on 31 March.</p>

<p>A few years later the scheme of the examination
was again reconstructed by regulations<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn74" id="fna74" name="fna74">74</a></sup> which came
into effect in 1848. The duration of the examination
was extended to eight days. The examination
lasted in all forty-four and a half hours, twelve of
which were devoted to problems. The first three
days were assigned to specified elementary subjects;
in the papers set on these days riders were to be set
as well as bookwork, but the methods of analytical
geometry and the calculus were excluded. After
the first three days there was a short interval, at the
end of which the examiners issued a list of those who
had so acquitted themselves as to deserve mathematical
honours. Only those whose names were
contained in this list were admitted to the last five
days of the examination, which was devoted to the
higher parts of mathematics. After the conclusion
of the examination the examiners, taking into
account the whole eight days, brought out the
list arranged in order of merit. No provision
was made for any rearrangement of this list
corresponding to the examination of the brackets.
The arrangements of 1848 remained in force till
1873.</p>

<p><a name="png.309" id="png.309" href="#png.309"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>301<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>In the same year as these regulations came into
force, a Board of Mathematical Studies (consisting
of the mathematical professors, with the moderators
and examiners for the current year and the two preceding
years) was constituted<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn75" id="fna75" name="fna75">75</a></sup> by the senate. From
that time forward their minutes supply a permanent
record of the changes gradually introduced into the
tripos. I do not allude to subsequent changes
which only concern unimportant details of the
examination.</p>

<p>In May 1849, the board issued a report in which,
after giving a review of the past and existing state
of the mathematical studies in the University, they
recommended that the mathematical theories of
electricity, magnetism, and heat should not be admitted
as subjects of examination. In the following
year they issued a second report, in which they
recommended the omission of elliptic integrals,
Laplace’s coefficients, capillary attraction, and the
figure of the earth considered as heterogeneous,
as well as a definite limitation of the questions in
the lunar and planetary theories. In making these
recommendations the board were only recognizing
what had become the practice in the examination.</p>

<p>I may, in passing, mention a curious attempt
which was made in 1853 and 1854 to assist candidates
to estimate the relative difficulty of the
<a name="png.310" id="png.310" href="#png.310"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>302<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>questions asked. This was effected by giving to
the candidates, at the same time as the examination
paper, a slip of paper on which the marks assigned
for the bookwork<!-- TN: hyphen removed based on frequency --> and rider for each question were
printed. I mention the fact merely because these
things are rapidly forgotten and not because it is of
any intrinsic value. I possess a complete set of
slips which came to me from Todhunter.</p>

<p>In 1856 there was an amusing difference of
opinion between the vice-chancellor and the moderators.
The vice-chancellor issued a notice to say that
for the convenience of the University he had directed
the tripos lists to be published at 8.0 a.m. as well as
at 9.0 a.m., but when members of the senate arrived
at 8.0 the moderators said that the list should not
be read until 9.0.</p>

<p>Considerable changes in the scheme of examination
were introduced in 1873. On 5 December 1865,
the board had recommended the addition of Laplace’s
coefficients and the figure of the earth considered
as heterogeneous as subjects of the examination;
the report does not seem to have been brought
before the senate, but attention was called to the
fact that certain departments of mathematics and
mathematical physics found no place in the tripos
schedules, and were neglected by most students.
Accordingly, a syndicate was appointed on 6 June
1867, to consider the matter, and a scheme drawn
<a name="png.311" id="png.311" href="#png.311"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>303<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>up by them was approved in 1868<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn76" id="fna76" name="fna76">76</a></sup> and came into
effect in 1873.</p>

<p>The new scheme of examination was framed on
the same lines as that of 1848. The subjects in
the first three days were left unchanged, but an
extra day was added, devoted to the elements of
mathematical physics. The essence of the modification
was the greatly extended range of subjects
introduced into the schedule of subjects for the last
five days, and their arrangement in divisions; the
total marks awarded to the questions in each of
the five divisions being approximately in a proportion
to the total marks assigned to the questions
in the first three days as 2, 1, 1, 1, 2/3 to 1 respectively.
Under these regulations the number of
examiners was increased from four to five.</p>

<p>The assignment of marks to groups of subjects
was made under the impression that the best candidates
would concentrate their abilities on a selection
of subjects from the various divisions. But it was
found that, unless the questions were made extremely
difficult, more marks could be obtained by
reading superficially all the subjects in the five
divisions than by attaining real proficiency in a
few of the higher ones: while the wide range of
subjects rendered it practically impossible to
<a name="png.312" id="png.312" href="#png.312"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>304<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cover all the ground thoroughly in the time allowed.
The failure was so pronounced that in 1877 another
syndicate was appointed to consider the mathematical
studies and examinations of the University.
They presented an elaborate scheme, but on 13 May
1878, some of the most important parts of it were
rejected; their subsequent proposals, accepted on
21 November 1878 (by 62 to 49), represented a
compromise which pleased few members of the
senate<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn77" id="fna77" name="fna77">77</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Under the new scheme which came into force in
1882 the tripos was divided into two portions: the
first portion was taken at the end of the third year
of residence, the range of subjects being practically
the same as in the regulations of 1848, and the
result brought out in the customary order of merit.
The second portion was held in the following
January, and was open only to those who had been
wranglers in the preceding June. This portion was
confined to higher mathematics and appealed chiefly
to specialists: the result was brought out in three
classes, each arranged in alphabetical order. The
moderators and examiners conducted the whole
examination without any extraneous aid.</p>

<p>In the next year or two further amendments
<a name="png.313" id="png.313" href="#png.313"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>305<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were made<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn78" id="fna78" name="fna78">78</a></sup>, the second part of the examination
being moved to the June of the fourth year, and
thrown open to all men who had graduated in the
tripos of the previous June. At the same time
the conduct of the examination in part <span class="allsc">II</span> was transferred
to four examiners nominated by the board:
this put it largely under the control of the professors.
The range of subjects of part <span class="allsc">II</span> was also greatly
extended, and candidates were encouraged to select
only a few of them. It was further arranged that
part <span class="allsc">I</span> might be taken at the end of a man’s second
year of residence, though in that case it would not
qualify for a degree. A student who availed himself
of this leave could take part <span class="allsc">II</span> at the end either
of his third or of his fourth year as he pleased.</p>

<p>The general effect of these changes was to destroy
the homogeneity of the tripos. Objections to the
new scheme were soon raised. Especially, it was
said—whether rightly or wrongly—that part <span class="allsc">I</span> contained
too many technical subjects to serve as a
general educational training for any save mathematicians;
that the distinction of a high place in
the historic list produced on its results tended to
prevent the best men taking it in their second year,
though by this time they had read enough to be
able to do so; and that part <span class="allsc">II</span> was so constructed as
<a name="png.314" id="png.314" href="#png.314"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>306<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to appeal only to professional mathematicians, and
thus the higher branches of mathematics were
neglected in the University by all save a few
specialists.</p>

<p>Whatever value be attached to these opinions,
the number of students studying mathematics fell
rapidly under the scheme of 1886. In 1899 the
board proposed<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn79" id="fna79" name="fna79">79</a></sup> further changes. These seemed
to some members of the senate to be likely still
further to decrease the number of men who took up
the subject as one of general education; and the
two main proposals were rejected, 15 February
1900 by votes of 151 to 130 and 161 to 129.</p>

<p>A few years later, in 1907<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn80" id="fna80" name="fna80">80</a></sup>, the board brought forward
another scheme, proposing changes so sweeping
as almost to destroy the identity of the tripos.
Under this the examination in part <span class="allsc">II</span> was abolished—a
change on which all parties were agreed. There
was introduced an examination, called part <span class="allsc">I</span>, confined
to elementary mathematics, which could be
taken as early as the second term of residence, and
for which in certain cases of failure a student could
present himself again, but this, although an examination
for honours, did not qualify for a degree.
<a name="png.315" id="png.315" href="#png.315"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>307<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>In the new part <span class="allsc">II</span>, taken normally at the end of
the third year of residence and qualifying for a
degree, candidates were given some option in the
subjects of their examination, and order of merit
was abolished. The first examination under this
scheme was held in 1908.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature in the history of the
Cambridge mathematical school is the fact that for
nearly two hundred years most students were
accustomed to rely for preparation for it on work
done with a private tutor or “Coach.” Towards
the close of the seventeenth century we first read
of these “pupil-mongers” (among whom Laughton
of Clare was the most famous) who made it their
business to prepare men for their “acts.”</p>

<p>With the rise of the senate-house examination
the importance of this class of teachers increased,
for success in that examination was regarded as the
crown of the academic course, and brought with it,
in the shape of a fellowship, an immediate competence
with a reasonable prospect of an assured
career. It was the business of private tutors to
prepare their pupils for the examination, and among
those who in this way came to the front shortly after
the middle of the eighteenth century were Richard
Watson, John Wilson whose name is still known by
its association with a proposition in the theory of
numbers, and Robert Thorp. The last named
<a name="png.316" id="png.316" href="#png.316"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>308<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>teacher was described, about 1761, as being “of
eminent use to young men in preparing them for
the Senate-House Examinations and peculiarly
successful”; and it was added that “one young
man of no shining reputation with the assistance
of Mr Thorp’s tuition had stood at the head of
wranglers.”</p>

<p>In a grace of the senate, passed in 1781, it is
stated that almost all sophs then resorted to private
tuition, and for more than a century subsequently,
the practice was well established. These were the
men who really directed the reading of the students.
Even non-residents, if reputed to be successful
coaches, drew pupils. Thus John Dawson, a
medical practitioner at Sedbergh, regularly prepared
pupils in the vacations for the senate-house
examination, and at least eleven of the senior
wranglers between 1781 and 1800 are known to
have studied under him.</p>

<p>During the nineteenth century the system
developed under two remarkable teachers, William
Hopkins, 1793–1866, and Edward John Routh,
1831–1907, to whom the vast majority of the better
known Cambridge mathematicians of this century
owed most of what they learnt in their undergraduate
days. Hopkins in the twenty-two years
from 1828–49, had among his pupils one hundred
and seventy-five wranglers, of whom seventeen were
<a name="png.317" id="png.317" href="#png.317"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>309<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>senior, forty-four in one of the first three places, and
one hundred and eight in one of the first ten places.
So too Routh, in the thirty-one years from 1858–88,
had between six hundred and seven hundred pupils,
most of whom became wranglers, twenty-seven being
senior in the tripos and forty-one Smith’s prizemen.
To organize teaching on this scale demanded rare
gifts.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be of interest to describe, by way
of example, the general features of Routh’s system.
He gave catechetical lectures three times a week to
classes of eight or ten men of approximately equal
knowledge and ability. The work to be done between
two lectures was heavy, and included the
solution of some eight or nine fairly hard examples
on the subject of the lectures. Examination papers
were also constantly set on tripos lines (bookwork
and riders), while there was a weekly paper of problems
set to all pupils alike. All papers sent up were
marked in public, the comments on them in class
were generally brief, and, to save time, solutions of
the questions were circulated in manuscript. Teaching
also was supplemented by manuscripts on the
subjects. Finally to the more able students he was
accustomed, shortly before their tripos, to give
memoirs or books for analyses and commentaries.
The course for the first three years and the two
earlier long vacations covered all the subjects of the
<a name="png.318" id="png.318" href="#png.318"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>310<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>examination—the last long vacation and the first
term of the fourth year were devoted to a thorough
revision.</p>

<p>Under Hopkins and Routh there was no trace
of what is called cramming; they might say that
a particular demonstration was so long that it could
not be required in the tripos, but none the less they
expected their pupils to master it. The system had
faults, but it had the merit of providing a systematic
grounding in a wide field of subjects. The effectiveness
of teaching of this kind was dependent on
intimate constant personal intercourse, and the importance
of this cannot be overrated. The scandal
of the system consisted in the fact that a man
was compelled to pay heavy fees to the University
and his College for instruction, and yet found it
advantageous at his own expense to go elsewhere
to get it.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of the nineteenth
century college lecturers began to share with the
coaches the general direction of studies. Post-graduate
work was also to some extent brought
under the influence of professors and university
lecturers—these not uncommonly suggesting subjects
for dissertations for fellowships, Smith’s prizes,
etc. But the students thus influenced were not
numerous, and it still remains true that the majority
of mathematical undergraduates are so out of touch
<a name="png.319" id="png.319" href="#png.319"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>311<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with the professors in the subject as to be unacquainted
even with their personal appearance.</p>

<p>Such was the mathematical tripos and its history.
Whatever its demerits, it dominated the situation,
and Cambridge mathematics and mathematicians of
the nineteenth century were the direct product of the
system it embodied. Judged by the output, I do
not think it can be said to have resulted in failure;
and perhaps Cayley, Sylvester, Adams, Green,
Stokes, Kelvin, and Maxwell—to mention no others—were
none the worse for having been compelled
to go through the course.</p>

<p>The reconstitution in 1907 of the tripos, and the
destruction of many of its distinctive features must
profoundly modify the future history of mathematics
at Cambridge, but forecasts on such a theme
would be useless.</p>

<p>The curious origin of the term tripos has been
repeatedly told, and an account of it may fitly close
this chapter. Formerly there were three principal
occasions on which questionists were admitted to the
title or degree of bachelor. The first of these was at
the comitia priora, held on Ash-Wednesday, for the
best men in the year. The next was at the comitia
posteriora, which was held a few weeks later, and
at which any student who had distinguished himself
in the quadragesimal exercises subsequent to Ash-Wednesday
had his seniority reserved to him.
<a name="png.320" id="png.320" href="#png.320"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>312<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Lastly, there was the comitia minora, for students
who had in no special way distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century an important part in the
ceremony on each of these occasions was taken by a
certain “ould bachilour,” who sat upon a three-legged
stool or tripos before the proctors and tested
the abilities of the would-be graduates by arguing
some question with the “eldest son,” who was
selected from them as their representative. To
assist the latter in what might be an unequal contest
his “father,” that is, the officer of his college
who was to present him for his degree, was allowed
to come to his assistance.</p>

<p>The discussion took place in Great St Mary’s
Church, and marked the admission of the student to
a position with new responsibilities, while the season
of Lent was chosen with a view to bring this into
prominence. The puritan party objected to the
semi-ecclesiastical character of the proceedings, and
in the course of the sixteenth century set themselves
to bring the ceremony into disrepute. The
part played by the questionist now became purely
formal, though a serious debate still sometimes took
place between the father of the senior questionist
and a regent master who represented the University:
this, however, came to be prefaced by a speech by
the bachelor, who was now called Mr Tripos, just
as we speak of a judge as the bench, or of a rower
<a name="png.321" id="png.321" href="#png.321"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>313<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as an oar. Ultimately public opinion permitted
Mr Tripos to say pretty much what he pleased, so
long as it was not dull and was scandalous. The
speeches he delivered or the verses he recited were
generally printed and preserved by the registrary,
and were known as the tripos verses: originally
they referred to the subjects of the disputations then
propounded. The earliest copies now extant are
those for 1575.</p>

<p>The university officials, to whom the personal
criticisms in which Mr Tripos indulged were by no
means pleasing, repeatedly exhorted him to remember
“while exercising his privilege of humour,
to be modest withal.” In 1710, says Mullinger<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn81" id="fna81" name="fna81">81</a></sup>,
“the authorities after condemning the excessive
license of the tripos announced that the comitia
at Lent would in future be conducted in the
Senate-House; and all members of the University,
of whatever order or degree, were forbidden to
assail or mock the disputants with scurrilous jokes
or unseemly witticisms. About the year 1747–8,
the moderators initiated the practice of printing
the honour lists on the back of the sheets containing
the tripos verses, and after the year 1755
this became the invariable practice. By virtue
of this purely arbitrary connection these lists
<a name="png.322" id="png.322" href="#png.322"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>314<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>themselves became known as the tripos; and
eventually the examination itself, of which they
represented the results, also became known by
the same designation.”</p>

<p>Mr Tripos ceased to deliver his speech about
1750, but the issue of tripos verses continued for
nearly 150 years longer. During the latter part of
this time they consisted of four sets of verses, usually
in Latin, but occasionally in Greek, in which current
topics in the University were treated lightly or
seriously as the writer thought fit. They were
written for the proctors and moderators by undergraduates
or commencing bachelors, each of whom
was supposed to receive a pair of white kid gloves
in recognition of his labours. Thus gradually the
word tripos changed its meaning “from a thing of
wood to a man, from a man to a speech, from a
speech to sets of verses, from verses to a sheet of
coarse foolscap paper, from a paper to a list of
names, and from a list of names to a system of
examination<sup class="fn"><a href="#fn82" id="fna82" name="fna82">82</a></sup>.”</p>

<p>In 1895 the proctors and moderators, without
consulting the senate, sent in no verses, and thus,
in spite of widespread regret, an interesting custom
of many centuries standing was destroyed. In
defence of this action, it was said that the custom
had never been embodied in statute or ordinance,
<a name="png.323" id="png.323" href="#png.323"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>315<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and thus was not obligatory, and further that its
continuance was not of material benefit to anybody.
Such arguments are not conclusive, and we may well
regret the disappearance of historic ties unless it
can be shown that they cause inconvenience, which
of course in this case could not be asserted.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
